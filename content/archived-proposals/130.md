They will also learn cost-effective methods for storage solutions, including the use of repurposed items and institutional surplus, and be introduced to the concept of creating solutions that can be used for both storage and display. Lastly, time-saving processes will be shared, including how to correctly and efficiently number garments, build one-size-fits-most boxes, and more."""

Long term preservation is a fundamental obligation for collecting institutions. However, all too often, collections receive the least amount of funding and resources, especially in smaller institutions. This session will provide guidance on budget-friendly methods for collections care, taking into consideration non-traditional resources and developing processes for better environmental stewardship. Panelists will share cost-saving tips for creating object solutions, selecting supplies and vendors, and more. Have an issue stumping you? Letâ€™s solve it!
