- Fostering and facilitating peer conversations inspired by stories of approaches and methods used by museum practitioners and community members (community members will share by zoom). 
- Participants will engage in approaches and methods used to collaborate with community members  and interact with activities as if they were participants and/or museum practitioners.

The methods and approaches shared in this session can be adapted to conversations with groups of about 5 to 15 people at once, then repeated as many times as needed with as many organizations needed for particular initiatives, projects, or programs. These approaches can work with community listening sessions, museum education, research, or evaluation experiences. For example, programming approaches inspired by popular education and community based participatory research can be adapted to elicit ways in which community members articulate their priorities for learning experiences while simultaneously creating emergent peer learning experiences to address their own challenges such as disaster risk resilience or environmental impacts

In recent years the country and world have been facing many challenges, communities’ reckoning with inequality and racial issues and their influences on risk and resilience. As museums are called to address systemic inequities and barriers, an important aspect is to  acknowledge communities' funds of knowledge for cultural resilience. In this hands-on session, participants will engage in and share approaches and methods for co-learning about risk resilience with communities through asset -based perspectives.
