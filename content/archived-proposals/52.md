Whose job is equity? This session illustrates the long-term benefits of having everyone invested in building an IDEA culture by bringing together fundraising, program, and marketing staff to discuss their unique roles in supporting IDEA work and the importance of cross-departmental collaboration. No matter what role you have at your institution, you will walk away with a new or renewed sense of how critical partnerships are to advancing IDEA work in museums.
