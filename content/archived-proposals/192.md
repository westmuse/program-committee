In this session we’ll outline an approach to guest service that centers the wholeness of individuals. Empathetic guest service is proactive, transparent, consistent, and compassionate. It does not mean always agreeing with visitors, but rather that you understand that their perspectives and feelings are valid. We will share lessons from a tumultuous period of heightened social stress, and how this approach has impacted how we resolve conflict and influenced an employee-centered decision-making process.
