1. Brainstorming institutional common goals, roles for interns, and potential partnerships with diverse community organizations  
2. Workshopping tools, programs, and/or communities for meaningful intern engagement 
3. Identifying ways to learn from intern input and feedback to grow their institution

These objectives will be met through collectively examining an example process for creating tools and communities to improve an existing internship program, brainstorming meaningful internship goals and outcomes with other session participants for a variety of institution types and disciplines, and discussing other potential tools or sharing out successful strategies to address these ideas and develop valuable internship experiences.

In the spirit of looking Forward, a large emphasis will be placed on engaging diverse students in internship programs. Participants will be encouraged to break away from traditional internship recruitment and work with community organizations to invite a wide range of student backgrounds, experiences, and skills to their organization."""

Interns can be (and are!) more than just a morning coffee run. Inviting interns onto your team is a great way to introduce support, generate diverse ideas, and create valuable learning opportunities for all involved. But not all internship programs are created equal. This session explores tools and engagement strategies to provide more meaningful experiences to interns and to the institutions they contribute.
