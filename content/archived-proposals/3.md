session_objectives = """1. Community & Stakeholder Engagement requires more than a one-size-fits-all approach.  Community & Stakeholder Engagement is often misunderstood and oversimplified. This session will break down several different forms of community engagement as a tactical approach to the planning and visioning for cultural projects from early stakeholder engagement through to exhibition content development and design. Different disciplines from designers and content strategists to technologists and business planning consultants use community engagement at different levels of the development’s lifecycle to address not just how an exhibition is designed, but also to address how a story is told.  2. Learning from different perspectives can be a valuable tool for shifting perspectives and/or validating the design direction  Often we uncover new lenses through which to tell the story by engaging different voices in the community. This is important not just to ensure the storytelling embraces a balanced, intersectional perspective, but also to capture and test the big idea in the first place. Community & stakeholder engagement can also be a powerful tool to win over hearts and minds and to unlock investment monies—to seed capital projects and advance a concept into an actualized project. By engaging the community early, we either validate the design direction or disprove our assumptions, requiring a shift in perspective and approach.  3. Providing an actionable framework to better understand when and how to engage the public This session will provide an actionable framework for practitioners working at different levels of cultural development projects. A moderator will pose questions to the panelists and invite them to share their practical tools, frameworks, and proven methodologies for more active and effective community engagement programs. The outcome will be a proven framework and useful tools for attendees to utilize within their own institutions."""
session_engagement = """Each panelist will present a community engagement from their different lenses. Then a moderated panel will pose questions to the panelists with the intention to compare and contrast their experiences and dig deeper into their methodologies and lessons learned. The audience will be invited to ask questions as well as we will pose the same questions to the audience to share their own experiences and lessons learned."""
session_scalability = """Different disciplines from designers and content strategists to technologists and business planning consultants use community engagement at different levels of the development’s lifecycle to address not just how an exhibition is designed, but also to address how a story is told.

We also have a 2nd panelist from another institution (not a client) who we found deals with engagement not just on the external level, but the internal level as well. We think this is an interesting method (engaging your staff as well!). They are unconfirmed and will need a back-up if they're unable to speak."""

Before embarking on a new development, community engagement is a powerful tool to test assumptions and either validate or change course.
