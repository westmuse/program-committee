session_objectives = """During this session, we will explore different aspects of sustainability from macro to micro scales including climate policy, building design and operations, and exhibition design.  Collectively, this session will benefit audience members of all knowledge levels on sustainability.

We strongly believe that topics such as these should be included more consistently in WMA programming, as environment and climate issues ultimately impact all aspects of the museum field.

1.     Participants will learn about “Culture Over Carbon,” an IMLS-funded National Leadership Grant.  The project created “roadmaps”’ to help participating museums, zoos, gardens, aquariums and historic sites understand their energy use and plan to become more efficient. The energy data from over 200 buildings also demonstrates sector trends and informs recommendations for current and future energy policy implications for museums.
2.     New construction provides an incredible opportunity to build for a more positive future.  We will use a case study in progress at the High Desert Museum to explore the decision making process for a new facility that is striving to connect its design to the mission and values of the Museum.
3.     At the scale of exhibitions, participants will learn about new guidelines for how to make their permanent and temporary exhibits more environmentally friendly while minimizing waste.  Different strategies will be discussed including energy efficiency, healthy materials, and designing for disassembly and reuse/recycling of materials.  While an individual exhibit may not seem like it has a global impact, when you consider the thousands of new exhibits around the world each year, small changes can make an incredible difference if we can work together to shift the industry."""
session_engagement = """Following the presentation, ample time will be reserved for questions from the audience and allowing participants to share their own ideas and experiences with the group.  Our intent is to illustrate how the ideas presented can be used and adapted to any institution in various ways."""
session_scalability = """Attention will be given to ensure that ideas presented will apply to museums of different scales, all building types (existing, remodels, or new construction), exhibits, and operations.

Museum professionals and sustainability experts will share the latest ideas and advancements in museum policy, design, and operations in environmental sustainability.  Participants will learn how they can engage in these programs or take these ideas back to their institutions and begin or advance their own sustainability initiatives.

Ample time will be reserved for questions allowing participants to share their experiences with the group. Presenters will provide prompting questions for the audience to engage in conversation.
