·      At the halfway point we will use an interactive “card exercise” to ask attendees to consider how such a partnership would support their mission.

·      Attendees will leave with handouts about how partnerships with prisons and hospitals benefit families and communities."""

**Museums, hospitals and prisons share a value: strengthening our communities by helping families during challenging times. Hear from museum professionals who have contributed education, research and design expertise to support these unlikely – but important – partnerships. The resulting installations engage children, families, and the staff who serve them, and highlight the connections between emotional engagement, feeling safe, and learning. Presenters will emphasize the equity and inclusion aspects of this work, and help you imagine similar collaborations. **
