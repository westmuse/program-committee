    a. We plan to discuss our process and approach to understanding communities around us, including identifying and selecting neighborhoods, connecting with community members and organizations, conducting historical research, and hosting neighborhood orientations for staff  
2. Participants will walk away understanding the value of resources and time spent compiling research and engaging with community partners as well as staff across the museum 
    a. We plan to discuss the ways in which the museum has benefitted from this project and how we see it continuing to do so up to our opening and beyond 
        i. We will share how our staff has responded to neighborhood orientations and how it has influenced their work

What is a cultural institution’s obligation and opportunity to understand the complexities of the people and places that surround it? By employing a variety of methods, including traditional data compilation and research as well as community organizing approaches such as reciprocal relationships building and old-fashioned door knocking, learn how we are understanding our neighborhood and our neighborhood is understanding us. Come for an engaged discussion where we ask tough questions and share examples of works-in-progress.
