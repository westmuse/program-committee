session_objectives = """1. Identify opportunities for inclusion or collaboration with groups within the community an institution serves or their field of study. Discuss how a partnership can be formed that is beneficial to all parties involved. Examples include work with indigenous Tribes, local artists, and correctional institutions.
2. Discuss how to evaluate inquiries from outside organizations, groups, or individuals, and how to approach these entities to discuss a potential partnership. What expectations should be set? What agreements should be made? Examine the options for this financial risk, including consignment, wholesale and vendor fairs. Discuss the possibilities for risk and reward, and what to consider when deeming your collaboration a financial or mission-based success or failure.
3. Briefly examine the possibilities for interpretation within your institution’s retail area, including artist information, community and staff recommendations and reviews, and tie-ins to seasonal or temporary exhibits and themes. What community resources can the store provide? How can more members of your institution’s staff be involved in the gift shop’s operations?"""
session_engagement = """Because all institutions vary in their approach to interpretation, mission, and nature of their retail operations, this session will allow for time for audience questions and discussion among themselves and with the presenters.

Ideas for discussion will be provided as well, including the opportunity to brainstorm an institution’s potential retail collaborators."""

Museum stores provide a unique opportunity for guests to interact with your site and take a piece of your institution home with them. In addition to providing revenue, gift shops can help museums work toward education and support goals by featuring and promoting the work of artists and groups in the institution’s community or relevant to their featured subject matter. Panelists with experience forming connections with local artists, tribal organizations, and correctional institutions on site souvenirs will discuss their triumphs and pitfalls with the audience and brainstorm ideas for mission-oriented collaboration.
