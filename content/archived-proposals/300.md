**Many museums have developed teen cohort programs that bring a recurring group of interested high-school-aged individuals together to contribute to that institution. Many of these cohort positions are paid, some are volunteer, some are public programs. In this session, a panel of educators who manage youth cohort programs discuss their cohort formats, best practices, and challenges.**
