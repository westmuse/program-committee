Conflict Resolution is a deliberate and conscious effort that encompasses psychology, humanity, anthropology, and sociology. With the modern prevalence of conflict, there is no better time to gain conflict intelligence than now. This timely session comes with truths that seek to empower people in understanding alternative ways of handling different types of conflicts. It also illustrates how conflict resolution can impact an organization just as much as it does the individuals involved.
Conflict cannot be avoided, but we should not let it escalate either. Professionals will see that conflict is not all that bad: with the right mindset and techniques, it can even improve relationships and organizational culture. With excellent conflict resolution skills, people can truly enjoy the communities they work in.
