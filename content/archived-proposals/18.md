session_objectives = """1. Empowerment: Participants will be introduced to their existent (often untapped) capability to act as radical change-makers. They will gain an understanding of how the complex personal learning pathways they have already developed through lived experience can serve as toolkits for institutional change. This empowerment disrupts forced binaries between personal and professional, letting individuals draw on strengths in both areas to advance in both realms.
2. Identification: Participants leave able to clearly identify the structures around them that carry implied values. This skill enables individuals to pinpoint clear opportunities and approaches for enacting more just and inclusive museums. They will be equipped to use values-driven practices to challenge reductive narratives, outdated conventions, and divisive binaries.
3. Activation: Once participants can see the tools needed for change and the sites to target for implementation they leave activated, no longer passively contemplating equity, but equipped to begin tangibly building equitable structures. This activity can be applied to the decrease of traditional methods of engagement and increase of decolonized practices across organizations."""
session_engagement = """Listening and Q&A as a full group will be punctuated by opportunities to write brief personal perspectives, turn-to-your-neighbor moments, and small group dialogues. A single hand-out to each participant will ensure they have access to needed prompts, and will result in their leaving with a personalized resource to carry their learning into the rest of the conference and their future work. A projected presentation will also be used."""
session_scalability = """This session presents a framework that combines theory and process. Rather than prescribe limited areas of application the session offers modes of engagement for individuals to apply where they are relevant. Participants own personal and professional experiences and contexts make up the applied content of the session such that what is presented is applicable to all social and organizational structures.

theme_relationship = """Equity and inclusion are a widely accepted basis for institutions maintaining relevance and impact in today’s world. Still, leading the way forward with those structures in place eludes many well-intentioned professionals. Effectively eliminating institutional violence and colonial  legacies requires agility, and responsiveness that only forward-leaning individuals can achieve. This workshop takes today’s standards of equity as a  minimum threshold and works to give professionals  the courage to move towards even more daring and beautiful aspirations."""
theme_comments = """Expanded engagement:
The session is designed with a final gesture that is prompted by the handout and enacted after the session using available sticky-notes as the vehicle. This optional, ongoing intervention carries the charge of values-driven museum structures out into the immediate reality. As they learned during the session, participants will look for systems (such as book titles available in a shop or transit options in the neighborhood) where they can disrupt neutrality and highlight active manifestation of values throughout the conference. This intervention will be carried into the digital realm through a social media component, expanding involvement beyond the conference.

Flexible proposal:
We understand that it is typically desired for session presenters to come from multiple organizations. However this session does not situate us as authoritative lecturers but rather centers the expertise of participants, guiding them to learn from themselves and each other. In that way there are a great many organizations and positions presented. That being said, we are agile in how we can facilitate this learning, and would be happy to discuss the committee’s suggestions about additional facilitators or integration with related proposals you see from other groups.

Harness the power of your own personal growth to demand and build structures that are founded in humane values. Working together with co-presenters, participants in this interactive, collaborative session will identify values that arise from diverse intimate struggles and derive tactics to disrupt binaries, colonialism, and other harmful structures at their institutions. Come away with fresh ideas and processes for overthrowing unjust structures to make room for real collaboration, community input, and boundless creativity.
