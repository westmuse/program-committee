**NOTES: Grief affects nearly every aspect of family wellbeing and solvency for millions across the United States.** The unexpected death of a loved one poses a dual threat, as it is both among the most common major life stressors, and the single worst lifetime experience, reported by Americans in national surveys.
**Losing a loved one is not only a personal tragedy, but casts a long shadow that can extend for decades** as it places surviving parents, children, siblings, and spouses at significant risk for impaired health, premature death, and underachievement.
**Grief and bereavement are an emerging public health crisis, with an impact on millions of families throughout the nation.** They shares a powerful intersectionality with multiple national public health emergencies, including COVID-19, overdose, homicide, and suicide. As such, bereavement plays a key gatekeeping role in determining whether we as a nation can turn the corner on these ongoing public health crises towards national recovery and wellbeing.
**Perhaps most concerning, our national life expectancy--an index of overall population health--has dropped by more than one full year. **This last happened nearly 80 years ago following the United States’ entry into World War 2.
**The implications of these statistics are sobering: They not only indicate that many middle-aged people of child-bearing and child-rearing years are dying, but that many children and adolescents are losing their parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and mentors.** Recurring bereavement under tragic and often-traumatic circumstances has now become a commonplace fact of life for many US residents. Further, COVID and our other spiking epidemics have set back progress in closing the racial health disparities gap by some 20 years.
**Racial inequalities in grief and bereavement are magnified across the life course as Black Americans are more likely than White Americans to experience the death of children, spouses, siblings, and parents.** Black Americans are three times as likely as White Americans to have two or more family members die by the time they reach the age of 30. Black children are three times as likely to lose a mother and more than twice as likely to lose a father by age 10 when compared to White children.
