This session will serve as a point of reflection and dialogue for the process of collaborative research between professional fields, and co-curation with incarcerated populations.

Topics discussed will include anti-oppressive frameworks for collaboration, intentionality within the co-curation process, and strategies for working with incarcerated populations.
