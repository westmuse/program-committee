 We will have group discussions to identify tactics for program development to help overcome exclusionary issues and connect with diverse communities. 
 
We will give action points on what we do during our program development process that has worked to reframe our own programming. 
 
We will engage in discussions on what we have learned through the process of collaborating and connecting with Utah’s diverse communities and how that has shaped our event organization practices and program planning.

We’ll show how engaging community partners in the process effectively shifts the end-goal of programming to be more mindful and inclusive. We will also demonstrate how it has impacted our program participants and their teaching strategies and perspectives."""
session_engagement = """This presentation is geared towards museum educators and program developers to help them reframe their pedagogical and facilitation approaches to science in a more inclusive manner. 

We will have group discussions to help audience members identify their own definitions of STEM and actively work on changing mental models. We will share our experiences with shifting our own departmental thought process and give effective practices that our museum implemented in our program development process."""
session_scalability = """  **Many organizations are located in areas with diverse communities and want to explore strategies and practices to connect and work closely with all communities. This session explores a case study of a specific workshop project that focuses on educators, but the presenters will share their experiences working with community partners and what worked and did not work in different situations. This approach is applicable to events, programs, and projects in multiple organizations from all types and sizes. Exploring how STEM is rooted in culture and how it often only considers the Western perspective is also an interesting and diversely applicable thought process and framework that can benefit multiple audiences.**

**In K-12 classrooms and beyond, STEM content is often presented primarily through a Western lens. The Natural History Museum of Utah’s STEM Rooted in Culture workshop series collaborates with community partners to empower Utah’s educators to teach STEM content through a culturally relevant and responsive perspective. We’ll share about how we strive provide a platform to Utah’s diverse community organizations, and hope that you leave with inspiration to begin community partnerships of your own.**
