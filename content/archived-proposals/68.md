2)	Audience recognizes the risks of neglecting workplace culture, and the benefits of creating a Social Committee or something similar.
3)	Audience members feel empowered to push for similar initiatives in their own institution. They learn how to start a social committee, how to gain institutional support, and examples of events and activities to try."""

-	Discussion opportunities to brainstorm ideas for gaining support and establishing similar initiatives at participants’ institutions
-	Presentation with powerpoint"""

Join the Burke Museum’s Social Committee as we take a fun break from the chaos of conferencing to talk about the importance of creating positive work environments for museum staff. Participate in a simple crafting activity while we explore the research on workplace happiness, share success stories from our own Social Committee, and brainstorm new ideas to take back to your own institutions.
