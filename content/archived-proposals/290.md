session_objectives = """EMPATHIZE - We’re all in the same boat. As the tides of digital marketing change with new technology and apps, there is always pressure to jump in and “go viral” right away. We’re also treading water in the ocean of content our audiences consume every day. It’s hard to stand out, but we can do so by creating content that aligns with the core values of our organizations. You have so much to offer! 

ENCOURAGE - You are wanted, not needed. You are in your role for a reason. You’ve shown that you have the skills and knowledge required to hold your position, and you hold value in your workplace. However, if you need a break here and there, the organization will not fall apart! Take that mental health day. Additionally, our audiences don’t always make the connection that there is a human with a specific role behind the screen. Removing pressure to respond to every complaint, customer service question (unrelated to your content), and message is tricky but necessary. Develop community guidelines to protect you from audience members who are looking to cause trouble.

EVALUATE - How can you keep things simple to protect your time? What platforms are you utilizing that your audience doesn’t engage with, and can they be deactivated? What content can you recycle and share on other platforms? Can you respond to comments and questions within normal work hours? Setting and maintaining workload and time off boundaries creates a more positive work experience."""
session_engagement = """Upon entry, participants will be asked to write down their organization name and digital marketing platforms in use. Depending on the size of the group, introductions will be made either in small groups or all together. 

Questions relating to each of the 3 Learning Outcomes will be presented and discussed with the group(s). Participants will be encouraged to share their experiences utilizing the tactics and suggesting other methods in which they’ve seen success."""
session_scalability = """Whether you’re working for a small nonprofit interested in digital marketing or you’re a Marketing Director overseeing social media interns for a global organization, the changing tides of the digital age can take a toll on our creative energy. Protecting your mental health by honoring your time, giving yourself grace, and adapting to maintain simplicity creates a more positive work experience.
