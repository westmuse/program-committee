COVID-19 dramatically altered modes of connection between museums and their publics. This session revisits a study conducted during 2020-21, asking participant North American museums how their digital engagement practices have changed since. Are museums still expanding their digital practice? Engaging global publics? Have commitments to diversity & inclusion, bolstered by the many accessibility benefits of online programs, remained a priority? This session examines answers to these questions and makes the case for continued digital engagement.
