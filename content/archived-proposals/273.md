Creating meaningful experiences through exhibition and visual display is one of our major goals for our communities, but what happens in between that? How do we maintain a safe and enjoyable experience for our guests, docents, and volunteers? This session will address the health and safety considerations of staff who work tirelessly behind the scenes and the front lines. Participants will learn to identify safety issues including hazards of common substances used in art handling.
