session_objectives = """Quite often these days, people open a meeting or read a web page that includes a variation of an indigenous land acknowledgement. This may include asking local tribal representatives to “perform” a land acknowledgement by way of an opening prayer or song in ceremonial regalia, which risks continuing a negative stereotype prevalent today, with the added potential to reproduce negative legacies of the museum trope. Rather than use a standard template with tribal names inserted, land acknowledgements must be unique and may require recognizing broader uses of the land by multiple tribes over time. Simply put, these lands were once occupied by indigenous people and many indigenous people still live on and use this land today. Museums and organizations can acknowledge the original inhabitants of the land but must also seek an understanding of current tribal land claims. Many are confused on whose tribal (whether aboriginal, ceded, or treaty reserved) lands they are actually upon. What, if any, issues arise with state and federal museums acknowledging they exist on tribal land? Panelists will engage with these issues and evaluate the phenomenon of land acknowledgements. Attendees will be given tools for learning whose land they occupy, ideas for thinking through the acknowledgment, procedures for writing  them and consulting about them. The ultimate goal is to move beyond the well-constructed land acknowledgment into the development of fruitful partnerships with tribes."""
session_engagement = """Session attendees will hear tribal perspectives of land acknowledgements from both tribal and non-tribal museum professionals, with discussion varying between what honors tribes and what might fail them in this process, and with heartfelt intentions, work together towards concepts of moving this current trend forward. Takeaways will be distributed to audience members, including:  1) distributing written samples of a variety of current land acknowledgements, 2) sharing Guidelines for Collaboration recently developed by the Society for Anthropological Research. Attendees will learn how to find out which tribes are to be spoken for in a land acknowledgement and how to reach out to the appropriate tribal contacts through resources such as the inventory of tribal museums, tribal historic preservation officers and tribal language programs. In addition, ample time for questions and discussion between panelists and attendees will be built into the panel session and directed by the moderator."""

Tribal land acknowledgements are rapidly growing in popularity among institutions and organizations, taking the form of opening statements in meetings and conferences, signage, or website messages. One might ask why land acknowledgements are being made in a growing number of settings, including the museum. Acknowledgement is a simple, powerful way of showing respect and is intended as a step toward correcting the practices that erase or freeze Indigenous people’s history and culture while inviting and honoring the truth. However, the land acknowledgement is also at risk of ending where it began, perhaps well-conceived and received, but merely a symbolic gesture with little to no follow through of engagement and real change. While land acknowledgements are well meaning, they are no substitute for substantive and ongoing Tribal relationships and understandings of tribal land claims.
