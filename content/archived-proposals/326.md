session_objectives = """Panelists will discuss themes through the use of case studies including the Indigenous Coast Narrative Project, The Indigenous Gardens Network (IGN), and the Suquamish Tribe Cultural District. 
 
Rooted in the theory of applied decolonization, the Indigenous Coast Narrative Project addresses the systemic erasure of Indian narratives by the California Mission system and presents a native-driven effort to disrupt the old regime, reclaiming the land and the road that connects us, and anchors our presence in a new narrative. 
 
The Indigenous Gardens Network (IGN) serves as a hub of collaborative, Indigenous-led land projects that aim to restore traditional gathering areas throughout Southwestern Oregon (SWO) so that First Foods and plants of cultural significance can be cultivated, harvested, and made accessible to Indigenous partners. 
 
The Suquamish Museum and House of Awakened Culture bookend newly reclaimed land with Indigenous centered gathering spaces, a Veteran’s Memorial and represents a shift in the way community spaces are formed and used. 
 
Through the exploration of these case studies and Q + A learning objectives will center on:
 
1.    The various forms of application, intentional omission, and integration of interpretive elements within land and place reclamation projects. 
2.    Understanding land stewardship and land-back principles and models in various forms and structures.
3.    Explore institutional relationships to living culture and practice as well as potential allyship roles for land reclamation/land stewardship projects."""

Indigenous led museum and nature-based projects generally include discussions of human connectivity to the land and non-human relatives. In this session we move beyond typical perspectives to explore a spectrum of projects that teach about our connectivity to the natural world, some inside, some out, some that engage visitors through conventional museum practice and some with no interpretation at all—rooting people to place and centering narratives of Native relationships with land by highlighting health, balance and reciprocation—elucidating Native values and knowledge related to the land and ultimately the rationale for “land back” efforts.
