**The Mariana Islands, comprised of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands exist on the edge of the United States in multiple ways. These islands are modern-day colonies of the US and are of significant strategic value to its US. This panel will focus on the challenges that are faced by the indigenous people of the islands in terms of managing museums and other similar educational institutions in heavily militarized, colonial spaces. **
