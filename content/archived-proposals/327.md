session_objectives = """1) How do you identify new goals for a program, either in the approach, the content, or the delivery, and communicate the objectives behind the changes you are making? Whether the programs are designed, trained for, or executed by paid staff or by docents, it’s important to keep everyone involved on the same page about why changes are being made and how they will improve the outcome. 
2) How have the resources for such programs (either within your institution or at the school level) changed over time? Museums are seeing significant changes in their volunteer base, while at the same time the staff involvement and professionalization may be increasing. How can staff support ongoing learning for volunteers so that they are on board with the institution’s priorities? School funding may be dwindling for arts education—what resources may be available to compensate? 
3) How do you integrate the classroom learning objectives with the content of the field trip—are the classroom and the institution aligned and supporting each other in their message? If the program is not aligned with stated goals in the school curriculum, what kinds of resources can you use to set your own standards for the appropriate grade level? How can your institution’s agenda have a positive impact on the community through what you have to bring to the discussion?"""

School field trips are among the most effective ways of connecting young students with museums and historic sites in their community. With the longstanding nature of these programs, many institutions are finding them ripe for reexamination. What new resources can be utilized and what changes in approach? Three varied local institutions will discuss the successes and pitfalls that they’ve experienced as they have reinvented their field trip programs to meet the needs of students today.
