session_objectives = """1) How can we as museum professionals work with our institutions and partner with others, specifically HBCUs, to create pathway/pipeline programs to help educate and diversify the collections field?

The Assessment Recruitment and Training in Collections and Conservation Fellowship Program (ART-CC) establishes an alternate avenue to Registration/Collection careers by providing on-the-job training for two recent HBCU graduates. 
The ART-CC Fellowship Program has provided one year of training in Los Angeles at LACMA for the two selected Fellows. During the second year in Nashville at the Fisk University Galleries, they will complete a collection assessment alongside Gallery staff and with continued mentorship from LACMA staff.  The two year program will enable the Fellows to be qualified and equipped with the skills needed for entry-level positions in Registration or Collections Management upon completion of the program.  

2) How can museums use the fellows feedback to implement greater change and inclusion within museums and their fellowship or internship programs?

3) Through this program, we plan to introduce HBCU students to the fields of Conservation and Registration and to demonstrate to the students the accessibility, viability, significance and cultural relevance of the fields. Through this capacity building, we hope to make a significant difference in the demographics of the next generation of professionals leading these fields. 

Through our partnership with Fisk, we hope to help advocate for critical positions within HBCU galleries and museums for collection assessments to provide greater understanding of their collection and accessibility to the general public and community."""
session_engagement = """All participants are welcome even though this fellowship is focused on Registration/Collections. By sharing this fellowship structure and development, we hope it can be applied across multiple areas within the museum field."""
session_scalability = """Fisk University Galleries and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) received an IMLS grant in 2021 to embark on an unprecedented fellowship program to create a pathway for HBCU graduates to jobs in the collection care fields.  In order to obtain a position within the museum collection care field, institutions have traditionally required a graduate degree and years of experience, often gained through unpaid internships. The Assessment Recruitment and Training in Collections and Conservation Fellowship Program (ART-CC) is a partnership between Fisk University Galleries and the LACMA. This program establishes an alternate avenue into these fields by providing on-the-job training in Registration, Collection Management and Conservation for two recent HBCU graduates.  ART-CC has two overlapping goals: to increase public access to Fisk University’s collection through a collection assessment and to simultaneously build capacity through the recruitment and training in Conservation and Registration of selected HBCU students and recent graduates. 

Of the seventeen areas of museum specialization surveyed in the 2015 Mellon Foundation Art Museum Staff Demographic Survey, Registration and Conservation were among the least diverse fields, with only 10% POC in Registration, and 11% POC in Conservation. Demographic trends in undergraduate and graduate enrollment in the fields of Art History, Criticism, and Conservation highlight that, without immediate and drastic intervention, we cannot expect positive change in the years to come.  Yet, adding diversity to these fields is of critical importance, as Registrars and Conservators have a strong voice in prioritizing what objects are conserved, how objects are stored and cared for, and how they are tracked (and therefore made accessible).

Through an important collaboration between the Fisk University Galleries and LACMA, the ART-CC fellowship offers invaluable exposure and supports the preservation of Black history, not only through programming but the development of underrepresented voices and future museum leaders. By sharing this fellowship program, we hope we can help inspire museums to develop similar programs with HBCUs to broaden access to and interest in collection care careers, and work towards a more equitable and inclusive field.
