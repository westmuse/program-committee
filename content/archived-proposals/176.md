session_objectives = """1.      Learn how to engage people – understand the history of the disability rights movement and its current standing as a social justice issue, learn about disability types and community, outreach, and advisors – with an outcome of authentic and meaningful inclusion
2.      Develop institutional commitment – put it in writing, create an access and inclusion plan, understand the role of staff training and staffing, discuss funding strategies – with an outcome of embedding access in all strategic and business practices
3.      Explore testing and improving ideas – try out prototyping and understand this is ongoing work to create engagement and diversity, learn from the summative evaluation findings from the comprehensive Junior Museum & Zoo project and how to apply the lessons – with an outcome of a growth-mindset that serves your audience’s needs"""
session_engagement = """Participation activities will include small and large group discussions, partner interviews, small group brainstorming, quiet writing time with individuals using worksheets, prototype building and iteration, group share outs and a time for questions and answers. Resources will include craft materials."""
session_scalability = """ The outcomes are scalable to an institution of any size or type because we will guide participants in how to create their own roadmap, even with limited access to funds or resources. Those with more means can create a different roadmap and strategies to achieve their defined outcomes. For participants that do not yet have leadership support for inclusion, they can affect change within their realm of responsibility. We will offer strategies for influencing leadership with the goal of institutional support.

theme_relationship = """Inclusion is forward thinking as a social justice issue and for museum relevancy. Making museum more accessible not only engages people with disabilities but also people with diverse income levels, ages, genders and racial or cultural backgrounds. Disability does not discriminate and affects people across the demographic spectrum. Research shows museums must stay relevant and engage new audiences, and inclusion of the disabled community is a key strategy due to the dearth of accessible experiences."""
theme_comments = """**Since 2010 the JMZ has been committed and working toward becoming a more accessible institution. Improvements have occurred over time with various projects and evaluation initiatives. **

**Please visit the [Palo Alto Junior Museum and Zoo’s website](mailto:https://www.paloaltozoo.org/Visit/Accessibility#https://www.paloaltozoo.org/Visit/Accessibility) if you would like to fully understand the accessibility offerings. The recently completed, 4.5 year IMLS-funded _Access from the Ground Up_ project included a broad array of accommodations throughout the newly rebuilt facility that support people with disabilities, and it transformed business practices at all levels. The process included extensive exhibit and accessibility support prototyping, special events for the disability community, comprehensive staff training, long-term engagement of an Accessibility Advisory Team, and in-depth project evaluation. The commitment to inclusion and accessibility innovation is ongoing. **

**This is a stand-alone session and due to its breadth will not merge with another session.**
