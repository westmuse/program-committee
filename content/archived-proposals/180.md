This session addresses museum workforce issues through the lens of an organization originally created in reaction to the pandemic. We will facilitate open discussion about issues – some of which are new and others of which have surfaced in light of the events of the past two years. The goal is to learn from each other by sharing what’s happening across institutions, identifying short- and long-term concerns and barriers to forward movement.
