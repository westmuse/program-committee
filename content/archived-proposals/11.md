Working agreements help teams surface shared values and address what could be issues before they happen. Secondly, participants will learn about how to integrate equity and inclusion exercises throughout an institutional practice, as well as how to facilitate critical conversations using these tools within a framework. Using positive exercises of inclusion, we can support diversity, promote inclusion, increase access and achieve equity in our museums. Lastly, participants will practice active listening. Active listening helps people avoid misunderstanding, build relationships, and overcome disagreements.

OUTCOMES: Participants will understand the advantage to using working agreements in team meetings; Participants will learn how to facilitate critical conversations and understand that we are one part of a systemic process; Participants will learn empathy through active listening."""

Many museums are addressing issues of institutionalized racism by engaging in DEAI (diversity, equity, access and inclusion) trainings. This session brings those trainings to WMA in an effort to continue an ongoing discussion of dismantling institutional barriers. Though changing policies and procedures usually comes from Executive and Board leadership, employees from across the institution can work to change cultural norms. This session will give practical tools that participants can use upon their return to work.
