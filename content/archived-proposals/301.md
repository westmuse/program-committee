Are you a collections manager or registrar that has said, “WTF?” more times than you can count? Join us for a moderated conversation between yourselves and a panel of people like you who have seen it all and want to share their wisdom. Here’s our chance to be honest about things that have gone wrong, share stories that sound too weird to be true, and support each other as we work to make things right.
