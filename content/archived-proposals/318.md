cindy sees collage as a cultural strategy we depend on to adapt to the material conditions of one's capitalist reality. To create a new world beyond capitalist consumption and cycles of trauma, cindy offers us a vision for repurposing of resources and capacities to create new ways of being and relating to the self, others and the earth. For cindy, collage has the potential to shift perspectives that allow for us to conjure up new possibilities in our journey towards liberation.
