session_objectives = """The workshop's goal is to inspire innovative thinking about volunteer programs and their potential to connect passionate individuals directly to the hands-on work of the museum. This goal will be addressed by:

- Diving deep into the volunteer program at MCD. Our volunteer program changed entirely during the pandemic, and volunteer support has allowed our small programs department to a) return to pre-pandemic levels of public programming and b) continue with at-home art programs/kits initiated during the pandemic. Lessons learned along the way, including strategies for volunteer outreach, relationship building, and transparent communication, are applicable to all types of museums.

- Connecting volunteer opportunities to the mission of the museum. This learning goal will also be addressed through the context of MCD. The workshop will include opportunities for participants to share out how volunteers are or could contribute to hands-on, mission-driven work in their institutions.

- The third learning goal is to collectively reflect on how to better incorporate volunteers' skills and interests into museums' daily work. How do we best leverage the unique abilities of volunteers at every level?"""
session_engagement = """The session will include a presentation about the volunteer programs at MCD, partner reflection, and whole group discussion about volunteer programs at participants' museums, and brainstorming about the next steps, including how to best incorporate the unique skill sets of volunteers into the work of the institution."""

This workshop may be particularly relevant to small to mid-size museums that, like MCD, developed alternative pandemic programming models that they would like to continue. However, designed to challenge current perceptions of volunteers' roles in museums, this workshop is relevant to museums of all sizes and scopes.

Time spent volunteering is a precious resource that must be appreciated. How can museums attract, retain, and build relationships with volunteers to build a team dedicated to scaling outreach efforts? The Museum of Craft and Design's volunteer model is founded on flexible programming, broad recruitment, relationship building, collective celebration, and complete transparency. 

We're a small institution, and what works for us may differ from what works for you. Join in the conversation and share lessons learned across museums.
