How do museums develop and maintain a vibrant docent program?   In this session, panelists from the USS Midway Museum will share their keys to developing a successful docent program for 2020 and beyond.     Having grown the program to  hundreds of docents, the panelists will focus on:  training/communication and integrating docents in the audio tour and  other technologies for a richer visitor experience.
