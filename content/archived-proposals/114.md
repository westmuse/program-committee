“Queering” is the process of challenging assumptions, including heteronormativity, gender binaries, and systems of oppression. How can we use the practice of queering to query what we do in museums? What assumptions do we make about visitors, the art or artifacts exhibited, and the institution itself? Participants will explore how to unloose a straightjacket of assumptions and practices at all levels of the institution, freeing up a more welcoming place for staff and visitors alike.
