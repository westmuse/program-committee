session_objectives = """This session is appropriate for a general audience at all professional levels. The session is an open forum – a back-and-forth dialog between audience and panelists on the exhibit-design process.  Panelists will speak briefly to introduce their role in the project before opening the floor for questions.  The objectives and learning outcomes address roadblocks (including internal stakeholders), unexpected finds, and lessons learned (including negative feedback) while developing Experience Oregon.  1.) Community engagement and management of stakeholder group.  The session will discuss the importance of community engagement and working with diverse stakeholders.  Corralling the various groups requires tenacity, patience, strategic planning, and constant follow through. Discussions will explore what worked, and what didn’t work. 2.) How to incorporate multiple perspectives and differing viewpoints.  Embracing multiple perspectives in a project can, and will, lead to conflicting viewpoints on interpretation. The audience should come away with insights on how to navigate differing viewpoints while including multiple perspectives.  3.) How to respond to, or not respond to, negative feedback. Presenting a fuller, more complete narrative of history (read – the good, the bad, and the ugly) may be challenging for visitors, stakeholders, or staff. One objective of this session is to talk about negative feedback, and some strategies to manage it. This session will provide an open, safe place to discuss the challenges of a participatory exhibit design process. Our goal is to provide concrete tools to apply this model within their institutions."""
session_engagement = """This session will be fueled by the audience’s engagement in the discussions. There will be a brief presentation by the panelists before opening the floor for questions on the content development process, challenges faced, and lessons learned. Tangible takeaways include: a scalable, collaborative model for other institutions to follow, professional development, and hard earned approaches to consider prior to beginning a similar project.   Resources needed: Computer for powerpoint presentation, projector, and screen"""
session_scalability = """The process followed to develop Experience Oregon can be scaled up or down to fit any size organization. The size of the institution will determine the size of the advisory committee/stakeholder group. Having inspired, resolute staff and/or volunteers, a committed board, and dedicated consultants will be the recipe for success.

How can museums target, work with, and attract a more diverse audience? This session explores how the Oregon Historical Society created their core exhibit Experience Oregon using participatory models (co-creation, collaboration) for exhibit development. This session is an open forum – a back-and-forth dialog between audience and panelists. Attendees will leave with steps and strategies on how to tell a more complete story, work with multiple groups, address conflicting perspectives, navigating roadblocks, and lesson learned.
