session_objectives = """This session will show how staff at Las Vegas institutions made decisions to collect items documenting a local mass shooting in October, 2017, and how those decisions affected the way the tragedy is interpreted and remembered. It is aimed at collections management staff, curatorial staff, and management at museums and cultural institutions.  Attendees will be hear about many issues, both practical and philosophical, that can arise when collecting and interpreting current, tragic, events. These issues include: what should be collected from the actual event, from memorials, and from the community; when should this collecting take place, and when should it end; how should the items be used once they are part of an institution’s collection; what issues will institutions face in dealing with government officials, the media, and the community; what financial burdens will institutions face and how can additional funding be found; how will institutions be involved with permanent memorialization of an event. Attendees will also learn how institutions’ roles change, both in the immediate aftermath of a tragedy, and as time passes. Attendees will receive tips and strategies for how to deal with collecting after mass tragedies so that they can help their institutions prepare for a similar event. They will also learn about resources available from other institutions who have faced collecting after tragedies, particularly mass shootings. Presenters will provide written procedures created specifically for rapid response collecting as well as examples of press releases and other public outreach."""
