session_objectives = """Panelists will be transparent about the process of equitable work (highs and lows/rewards and discomfort) as well as encourage and inspire others to keep going and/or take the leap to do this work. Panelists will also give examples of the steps that CAM is taking via a suite of professional development resources and activities including workshops and virtual spaces for networking and resource-sharing, mentoring programs for EMPs; roundtable discussions for senior level managers; and in-person networking events across California.

Each panelist will share their unique perspectives and experiences assisting CAM with working toward becoming a more welcoming space. Kristen M. will share her perspectives as a board member who oversaw the Equity Task Force and worked closely with consultant, Dina Bailey, on setting up focus groups, analyzing survey data, and drafting CAM’s first Equity Action Plan. Carolynn B. will discuss her experience on the Equity Task Force, the importance of a collaborative process, and advocating for more inclusive language and experiences. Gladys O. and Brittin R. provided their feedback as focus group members and expanded their engagement to serving on the Equity Advisory Committee. They will share their experience as focus group members and the importance of holding organizations accountable."""

CAM’s variety of current and forthcoming Centering Equity resources are available to California museum professionals, and attendees are encouraged to participate in the programs that would serve them.

The California Association of Museums is implementing its Centering Equity project, a necessary move toward working collaboratively with underrepresented museum professionals, and addressing the internal barriers that prevent more equitable access and practices. In this candid conversation with CAM staff, board members, and stakeholders, learn about CAM’s process for creating a suite of professional development resources and activities to help California museums, and CAM, address systemic racism and exclusions that exist within the museum field and work environments.
