session_objectives = """The session aims, through constructive critique and dialogue, to inform audience  members about ways of meeting challenges encountered while creating, installing, and presenting exhibits -- issues for exhibit practice that the exhibit raises. Attendees at this session will engage with curatorial practice and visitor engagement through discussions revolving around best practices in exhibit work.   In addition to critiquing the single exhibit, the staff at OHM is also interested in hearing impressions from the critique panel and the audience about the new exhibit and experiences at OHM, to incorporate as they design their next experiences. Takeaways will be the notes (mental or written) that audience members make as they listen and participate.  Spontaneity is a hallmark of the session, so the specific takeaways cannot be predicted in advance. Past sessions have generated new ideas and approaches especially for operationally bringing exhibits from idea to reality.   Tangible takeaways include 1) handouts outlining OHM’s exhibit development process, 2) handouts with information and links to current resources on exhibit design, and 3) information on best practices in community engagement through exhibit design.  Finally, as the session organizer, two of my goals in taking over the session planning in 2018 has been to expand the pool of Critiquers, and to bring in new voices to the panel."""

The ability for audience members to hone their exhibit critiquing skills, while learning from experiences of other professionals in the field, as we examine current exhibition practice, should leave all attending thinking about how they might apply what they learn to move their exhibits and institutions FORWARD."""
theme_comments = """Session Abstract: Creating an exhibit, in any discipline, is not a task for the faint of heart. It takes considerable vision, collaboration, planning, and effort to craft an exhibit with a clear purpose, inclusive narrative, and broad engagement. Each year, the WMA annual exhibit critique session shares out observations and assessments of a current exhibit. These have come from a wide variety of museum types, and have covered a range of topics, with the overarching goals being to help the field recognize excellence, create critical dialogue, and to engage museum professionals at WMA in a reflexive process of analysis of exhibit practice in the 21st century. The session focuses on critique that is analytical rather than descriptive. We review large exhibitions seen by thousands of people, small innovative exhibits, and exhibits focused on underrepresented topics. The “critiquers” feature regional museum professionals, usually curators, exhibit developers/designers, educators, engagement, and/or collections folks, who each critique the exhibit from their own professional perspective - what works well, areas they see that didn't work as well or that confused them, innovative ideas the exhibit highlights (could be tech, content, presentation, design, programming, etc.), and questions they have for the exhibit creation team. Select members of site museum’s exhibit creation team has opportunities to share their exhibit, the ideas/intentions/goals behind it, what they like best about it, what they would do differently if they could, next steps if any, and answer the reviewers questions in dialogue with them and the audience.
