session_objectives = """The purpose of this session is to help attendees gain a clear understanding of how to draft a fundraising letter to support museum programs and exhibitions. In the current competitive funding climate, fundraising needs to be spread across many professional areas. Museums need all of their staff members to be part of fundraising efforts, but so many of us don’t know how to write about our ideas. Funders are interested in the positive impact we have on our visitors. Museum professionals know that better than anyone, but don’t often articulate it well in grant proposals. Some Museums hire outside consultants to do writing work they could very easily do themselves if they had just a little instruction. This session will explain the basics of articulating need, goals, objectives and evaluation. Participants will:
1.      Learn to focus your attention on writing without distractions.
2.      Understand what organizational details you need before approaching a funder. 
3.      Write using simple exercises that outline how to structure a program description for funders.
4.      Use and take away succinct editing instructions to examine and revise your writing."""
session_engagement = """This classroom-style presentation is an active writing workshop with multiple timed exercises that participants engage with individually. At the end of the presentation, participants will have written for about an hour, having learned how to approach writing with a quiet mind, put your ideas in order, and edit afterward. Writers will walk away with writing tips and a succinct proposal outline to edit and send to funders."""
