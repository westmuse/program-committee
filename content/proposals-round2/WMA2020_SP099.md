Team working agreements are the first step to good team-building. Working agreements help teams surface shared values and address what could be issues before they happen. Using positive exercises of inclusion helps support diversity, promote inclusive facilitation during difficult conversations, increase access and achieve equity in our museums. Lastly, participants will practice active listening. Active listening helps people avoid misunderstanding, build relationships, and overcome disagreements. As a result of this session, participants will understand the advantages of using working agreements in team meetings; how to facilitate critical conversations and understand that we are one part of a systemic process; and learn empathy through active listening."""
