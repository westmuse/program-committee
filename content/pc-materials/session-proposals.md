BELOW IS THE OLD PROCESS FOR REVIEWING PROPOSALS. WHILE THIS PROCESS SHOULD NOT BE FOLLOWED, IT IS BEING LEFT UP AS IT MAY PROVIDE VALUE TO SOME. FOR 2022, PLEASE REVIEW [ALL PROPOSALS](https://pc.westmuse.org/proposals/) WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE [WMA PROPOSAL REVIEWING GUIDELINES](https://pc.westmuse.org/pc-materials/reviewing-guidelines/) AND SEND IN YOUR REVIEW ON THE RANKING SHEET (EMAILED) BY APRIL 29, 2022. 





WMA Proposal Reviewing Guidelines



Each PC member must read ALL of the proposals submitted. Please be sure to bring a copy of the proposals (digital is encouraged) with you to the meeting, and be prepared to discuss them in detail. Before the first meeting, please complete the following steps:

1. Read all the [Guides for PC Members](/pc-materials/) thoroughly (If you have any questions, please ask the Co-Chairs)
2. Download the "[PC Session Assignments](https://pc.westmuse.org/files/WMA2020_round1_pc_assignments_final.xlsx)" document
3. Find your name in the column "Assigned to"
4. Review ALL of the [session and workshop proposals](https://pc.westmuse.org/proposals/)
5. Read all your assigned proposals thoroughly for content and value it would bring to the Annual Meeting
6. Call or email the Proposer, and use the "[Session Assignments Worksheet](https://westmuse.org/sites/westmuse.org/files/documents/Session_Assignment_Worksheet.pdf)" to guide your discussion (and to make notes)

* **Contact the proposers of your assigned sessions before January 3, 2020.** It is very important for you to speak to the proposers and take careful notes - proposers are expecting to be contacted by someone from the PC by January 3, 2020.
* Become an expert in your assigned sessions. It is very important for you to speak to the proposers and take careful notes to understand the motivation, objectives, and justification for the presenter in greater detail, as well as other details not obvious in the proposal itself. You should be prepared to explain what your assigned sessions are about in detail, as well as answer questions from the PC using notes from proposers.

8. Read all the remaining proposals thoroughly, and score them in advance of the meeting using the "[Session Scoring Sheet](https://pc.westmuse.org/files/WMA2020_Round1_ScoringSheet_final.xlsx)"
9. Please rate all of the sessions on the 2020 Session Scoring Sheet and come with a printed copy.
