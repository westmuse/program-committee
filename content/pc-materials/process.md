Summary of the steps taken by the Western Museums Association (WMA) staff and the Program Committee (PC) to create the program for the WMA Annual Meeting.

## Roles & Responsibilities

**Co-Chairs:** Manage the process of the meetings and focus on the holistic and individual content of the sessions; Assist in developing other programmatic elements of the conference; Advise staff on content and logistics related to the Program.

**PC Members:** Review all session proposals; Contact the proposers of your assigned session proposals to more fully understand the intent of the proposal.

**WMA Staff:** Manage the data (proposals, presenter contact info, session feedback, etc.) and logistics of the PC – including acknowledging receipt of proposals, confirmation / rejection letters to proposers; Develop Preliminary and Final Program.

## Guidelines

In the PC’s work, PC members are representatives of WMA. Conversations with proposers, presenters, as well as any other participants should be professional, neutral, and confidential. All conversations during the PC Meetings are strictly confidential; this is particularly important so that PC members are able to speak candidly in order to develop the best program possible.

## Activities (does not apply to 2022)

1. **Formulating the PC.** Committee members serve for three years in order to provide continuity to the process. Co-Chairs usually serve for two years, replaced on alternate years. It is vital to have museum professionals from the upcoming host venues on the PC in order to take advantage of local opportunities and to develop a local flavor to the program. It is also important to have representation from the crucial segments of the museum profession, the member states of the Western Region, and other important constituencies. The PC for the coming year is finalized by the current year Annual Meeting in order to use it as a recruiting tool for session proposals and other program ideas.
2. **Call for Proposals.** The formal call for proposals—sessions and workshops—for the coming year is posted on the WMA website by the Annual Meeting. The deadline for submissions is usually late November to early December as determined by WMA staff and PC Co-Chairs. Staff and co-chairs will also determine an internal extended deadline to allow time to fill any potential programmatic gaps. Only proposals submitted in writing are accepted.
3. **Assignment of Proposals.** WMA staff processes all proposals and posts them to the WMA PC wiki. Before the first PC meeting in mid-January, PC members read all proposals and grade them on a 1-5 scale. In addition, each PC member is assigned a few (3-5, depending on the number of submissions and PC members) proposals to shepherd through the program development process. Doing so requires one or more conversations with the session proposer in order to become very familiar with the proposal, address perceived deficiencies in the proposals, and otherwise prepare to represent the proposal to the PC in the January meeting. This assignment is determined by both the PC Co-Chairs and WMA staff, and is intended to take advantage of each PC member’s professional expertise and familiarity with the subject of the proposal.
4. **First PC Meeting.** The first formal meeting of the PC occurs in mid-January in the host city. It occurs in conjunction with the WMA Winter Board Meeting so that any last-minute coordination can take place. The principal purpose of this meeting is to provisionally accept the sessions and workshops that will be included in the final program. Some proposals will be withdrawn by their proposers after the first PC meeting, so the PC usually provisionally accepts a few more proposals than the program schedule can comfortably accommodate. A specific agenda for the January PC meeting details an ideal sequence of the events in order to achieve all essential objectives. PC Co-Chairs conduct the meeting, assisted by WMA staff.
5. **Between meetings.** After the January meeting, PC members contact all provisionally accepted proposers of their assigned sessions in order to provide PC feedback and to nurture resubmissions. WMA staff will contact proposers who were not provisionally accepted. All provisionally accepted proposals must be resubmitted, even if no changes are required, in order to manage the process effectively. WMA staff the places both PC comments and resubmitted proposals on the wiki. PC members read all resubmissions and rank them 1-5
6. **Second PC Meeting.** The second PC meeting has the principal objectives of finalizing the list of program contents—sessions and workshops—and determining a preliminary program schedule and usually takes place in early March in the host city. It also assigns PC members to carry out program-related responsibilities, such as helping to edit the printed program, developing a list of poster sessions, interfacing with the Host Committee, and refining accepted workshops. In all of these auxiliary assignments, PC members work under the direction of WMA staff. A specific agenda details this second PC meeting.
7. **Second Meeting Follow-up.** WMA staff communicates to session and workshop proposers the results of the second meeting. PC members continue to shepherd their assigned sessions in all needful ways until remaining issues are completely resolved.
