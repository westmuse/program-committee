Each year, questions arise from Program Committee (PC) members as to what specific elements should be considered as they read through the proposals. These notes supplement the [WMA Program Rubric](https://westmuse.org/sites/westmuse.org/files/documents/WMA2023/WMA%20Program%20Rubric.docx) and [Goals and Values](https://pc.westmuse.org/pc-materials/goals-values/) list. This list addresses the logistical realities of the WMA Annual Meeting: conference size, marketing approach, and other issues that impact the type of program that is possible. Remember that only about 40 sessions will make it to the final program, so these notes, along with the Goals and Values list, will help you in your efforts to score the sessions fairly. The PC has the right and the responsibility to recommend to the session proposer that changes be made according to the needs of the Annual Meeting.

## Representing WMA

In the PC’s work, they are representatives of WMA. Conversations with proposers, presenters, as well as any other participants should be professional, neutral, and confidential. All conversations during the PC Meetings are strictly confidential; this is particularly important so that PC members are able to speak candidly in order to develop the best program possible.

## Program and Session Diversity

When evaluating session proposals, remember that in addition to a diversity of topics and session styles, it is important that we seek a blend of participants in terms of gender, ethnicity, types of museums represented, sizes of museums represented, and geography. Also, it is critical that the overall program be balanced by track, as well as professional level (introductory vs. advanced). For example, if we find a high number of collections-related sessions and a lack of administration-related sessions, the PC may need to brainstorm session ideas to provide the appropriate amount of diversity.

If the topic is too narrow, please ask how the session can be broadened to appeal to a larger audience. A narrow topic can be defined as one that might only attract a very small audience. Some narrow topics can be quite fascinating, but because of the anticipated size of the Annual Meeting, generally we cannot realistically support such sessions. Such a topic can be supported if the proposer understands the need to build a bridge between their topic and the interests of the larger museum field—this can sometimes be accomplished by bringing in other speakers with a related interest in a different type of museum or other diverse perspective. 

Please note, the PC is evaluating sessions on what is proposed, though, and not on the potential of what a session could be if certain elements were changed.

## Conflict and Perspective

Some of the most interesting sessions are those with wildly different perspectives. Does the proposal recognize this possibility in the session description? If the session has a hint of controversy, suggest any of your professional contacts that may lend a different perspective; stir the pot!

## Community Representation

For any session that discusses a specific group of people, especially if they are the intended audience or focus of an exhibition or program, at least one member from the specific group should be represented on the panel. When session attendance is cost prohibitive for the individual(s), WMA will waive the in-person requirement for all presenters and virtual or recorded participation will be allowed to ensure an appropriate and balanced community representation in the session.

## Titles

Please think about the session title. Does it convey the content, or is it too confusing, too cutesy, too obscure? Creative titles are fine, but they need to clearly communicate what the session is about. Some of our marketing material will only include the titles of sessions and not the descriptions.

## Vendor Proposed Sessions

We do encourage and accept proposals from for-profit entities. In most cases, we prefer to have a museum professional moderate, however each session must be judged on a case-by-case basis. In every case, we prefer not to accept sessions where there is a business relationship between the vendor on the panel and the other panelists. There should always be a non-client included on the panel to address the topic. Furthermore, in no instance can a session include promotion of a business. The vendor must limit themselves to addressing the issue.

## Audience Participation

Every year, our evaluations consistently include comments about increasing the amount of time allotted for audience discussion. Generally, the most successful sessions include a healthy amount of interaction with the audience. This is not necessarily appropriate for all sessions, but please keep in mind that attendees need time to ask questions and address issues that the speakers may have glossed over or failed to communicate to the audience. Does this session recognize time for audience questions or other forms of participation or engagement?

## Clarity

Is the proposal articulated clearly in 75 words or less? Did the proposer feel the need to add additional clarification? Remember, only the 75-word description appears in the program. If what is presented in the proposal is unclear, muddled or badly written, the ability of the proposer to develop this into a great session should be seriously questioned and is a component in the overall evaluation for acceptance.

Ideally, a session description should give readers:

1. What the topic/issue is;
2. Why it relates to them (very important!);
3. What aspect of the topic the session presenters will present, or how they will present;
4. What attendees will learn from the session, what solutions/knowledge they will come away with.
