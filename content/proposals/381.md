This session explores the dynamic relationship between education and curation by advocating for the incorporation of dedicated educational spaces within gallery settings. This session is inspired by the current exhibition at the Discovery Center where we built a ‘Water Bar’ inside of the exhibition, the bartenders are education staff, staging water tastings, pop-up activities and activations throughout the run of the exhibition. The session will explore innovative strategies the Discovery Center and other museum spaces have taken in incorporating permanent education spaces in gallery spaces, and practical examples of how galleries can serve as hubs for both appreciation and learning. The presenters will share key lessons learned, visitor feedback, and learning outcomes throughout the session.
