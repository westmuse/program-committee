We will also discuss different techniques to use when working with colleagues and community partners to solicit a diversity of language, ideas, needs, activities, goals and objectives to include in grant proposals. Lastly, we will review common professional writing tips to help organize our thoughts and write more clearly and persuasively. This session will help both fundraisers and general Museum staff members understand that soliciting income from Foundations and Government Agencies is a process that includes many elements and questions, and is best accomplished by including multiple voices. Fundraising is most successful when we can do it together. Using a grant proposal structure and purpose, participants will learn techniques to find better focus, write more clearly, and listen more actively."""

Writing grant proposals for Foundations and Government Agencies require collaboration between multiple staff from development, curatorial, collections, education, and our community partners. This session will combine individual grant writing instruction with exercises to guide us all toward more collaborative work. Audience members will leave this session having learned how to approach your next grant proposal by improving your own focus and writing as well as by listening more actively to your colleagues’ ideas and needs.
