session_objectives = """During this session, participants will come up with their own working agreements. Team working agreements are the first step to good team-building. Working agreements help teams surface shared values and address what could be issues before they happen. Secondly, participants will learn about how to integrate equity and inclusion exercises throughout an institutional practice, as well as how to facilitate critical conversations using these tools within a framework. Using positive exercises of inclusion, we can support diversity, promote inclusion, increase access and achieve equity in our museums. Lastly, participants will practice active listening. Active listening helps people avoid misunderstanding, build relationships, and overcome disagreements.

OUTCOMES: Participants will understand the advantage to using working agreements in team meetings; Participants will learn how to facilitate critical conversations and understand that we are one part of a systemic process; Participants will learn empathy through active listening.
