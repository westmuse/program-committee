It’s no secret that museums of all sizes are doing great work around the country, and quantifying and sharing wins is more important than ever. Awards can help sites increase visitation, improve publicity, secure funding, boost morale, and encourage innovation. Join our discussion of Oregon Heritage, WMA, and AASLH awards programs as we share tips, demystify the nomination process, and explain how awards can be powerful marketing tools and catalysts for growth.
