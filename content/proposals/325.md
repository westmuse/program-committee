**Historically, museum people have determined content, objects, interpretation, and intended visitor experience. It’s formulaic, which is why ‘creation for’ instead of ‘with’ has been employed for so long. The fear that loosening grip on the controls allowing our “end users” to drive us off a cliff is real and mired in colonial control strategies. We’ll challenge attendees to ponder, “Why continue using these models?”, “what if we didn’t?”, “how might our community become integral to our success?”.**
