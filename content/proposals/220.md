Measuring and reducing GHG emissions from energy use is critical to empower cultural institutions to reduce their contributions to climate change. _Culture Over Carbon_ is an IMLS National Leadership Grant project born in the PNW. Join this introductory-level session on why and how to measure and monitor your building’s energy and hear examples of how future energy management and local policy expectations can affect energy and capital planning.
