We will confirm who will present from partner organizations as possible. If partners cannot participate in person, we will explore other ways to include them in the session via recorded stories, prepared statements, or video call.

Our session will focus on collaborations between museums, tribes, and community partners to co-develop cultural programs. The content will focus on the development of the _Big River & Its People _curriculum about Celilo Falls. Presenters from each of the four partner organizations--Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, Museum at Warm Springs, Confluence, and High Desert Museum--will share how we developed the curriculum together and what we've learned through the process.
