How does your institution authentically welcome staff and make space for reflection for those whose identities fall on the margins? Hear from a panel comprised of museum professionals from institutions large and small on the power of identity- based affinity groups. You will also learn about legal considerations to contemplate before launching similar groups at your museum from a labor and employment practice attorney that has worked closely with museums establishing Employee Resource Groups.
