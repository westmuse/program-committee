First presented as a concept at the 2010 AMSTERDAM ERC by the green subcommittee of ICEFAT and more recently as part of “Safe Art, Safe Planet” at the 2019 Philadelphia ARCS, this call to arms endeavors to raise a group of volunteers for grant writing and solicitation of government support for a sustainable exhibition crate resource for non profit and adjacent fine art and exhibition end users. Welcome to the Island of Misfit Crates.
