Join this participatory design exercise where you will be actively role-playing one of the diverse, multiple voices which goes into creating a new museum exhibit involving indigenous storytelling. We will begin this session demonstrating how this was achieved for the recent exhibit at the Heard Museum "Substance of Stars" and each attendee will then have an opportunity to develop their own design approach. Teams will be established from the perspective of the client (institution), curator, architect, exhibit designer, artist and the indigenous community whose story is being told.
