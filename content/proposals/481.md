session_objectives = """This session aims to demonstrate how elevating teens’ voices by focusing on teen led/codesigned program formats is an effective way to instill ownership, belonging, and trust in community organizations. The expertise offered by teens on the panel is the most valuable part of this session. Their presence in the conference will provide unique insights about their personal experiences building connections through educational programming. 
We will bring teens from three distinct programs of different sizes and structures, each offering a unique perspective. Not only will they discuss challenges and tips for creating teen-led spaces in which participants feel comfortable sharing ideas and concerns with adult facilitators, but they will also provide insight into how peer mentoring has allowed them to create a constructive dialogue with other teens.
We will promote group discussions to identify tactics to help professionals of varying levels of experience in working with teens to develop worthwhile programs which highlight and elevate the youth voice. We will give actionable takeaways on what we do during our program development process that has worked to reframe our own programming. Our adult presenters come from many different backgrounds with varied museum and educational work experiences. With experience in established as well as new programs, they will consider topics such as starting and/or strengthening community partnerships, sustaining an open dialogue with participants, and building trust in our programs within the community. Participants will also have the opportunity to interact with each other and learn from sharing their experiences."""
session_engagement = """Upon entering, participants will receive a sticky note to write down questions about teen programming to group together for the panel to discuss. Participants will engage in a movement activity to promote self reflection and connect with others possessing similar experiences. Participants will discuss in small and large groups, with ample opportunity to interact with the presenters. We will need Post-it notes and pencils/pens for the audience to write their questions on."""

Different specialized museums and community organizations can use these approaches to create more inclusive and supportive experiences that empower young people while also strengthening community ties. By integrating youth voices into their programming and building programs for teens by teens, organizations of all kinds can build stronger, more engaged visitor communities and ensure that their spaces remain relevant, dynamic, and welcoming to all generations.
