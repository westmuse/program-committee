Museum curators will better understand technology trends and life-cycles to make better decisions about when to invest in technology to engage users and enhance experience in the built environment.

Understanding how content is key. Choosing a technology platform inherently means choosing a content style. How content and audience needs to be considered prior to selecting technologies in order to maintain wonder and novelty to museum goers."""
