A sustainable building is one that integrates all building systems in harmony, starting with a program shaped by deep engagement with your team. To start the process, we use a proprietary framework we developed called VALUES to help your stakeholders prioritize, set targets for goals, and establish metrics for success. VALUES stands for Viewing Architecture through the Lens of User Experience and Sustainability. VALUES is a dynamic, adaptive framework to design, promote and prove that sustainability will enhance the user experience. User Experience (UX) in buildings is the 
totality of the effects felt by a user in interaction with the building, including the influence of usability, usefulness and emotional impact during interaction, and savoring the memory after interaction."""

In this interactive session, participants will explore holistic sustainability categories beyond energy, including Health & Well-being of occupants, Indoor Environmental Quality, and Materials to recognize how different building performance indicators relate to one another and address operational concerns.
