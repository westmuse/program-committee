**This presentation shares how the Education and Curatorial Departments at Columbia River Maritime Museum collaborated to address burnout, siloed work environments, and new forms of access to the museum’s collection. By adjusting job descriptions and supporting new programming – including CRMM’s Senior Enrichment Programs – the departments encouraged staff passion while also fulfilling the museum’s 2020-2025 Strategic Plan.**
