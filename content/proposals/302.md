session_objectives = """State museum associations (SMA) are a relatively unknown source of assistance in many areas. This session will include presentations from four SMA leaders that focus on how museums and individual museum workers can use these resources to undertake advocacy on
the local, county and state level.

Objective/Outcome 1:
 Give museum workers resources for local advocacy efforts; e.g.,:
 - adding elected officials to museum's email list
 - using an advocacy calendar that COSMA or your SMA provides 
 - responding to advocacy alerts 
Attendees will leave with templates and materials for immediate use.

Objective/Outcome 2:
 Show how museums, state associations, and other organizations can collaborate for the benefit of the field; e.g.:
- group meetings with legislators
- formal Advocacy Days focused on museums, arts, humanities, and other areas of mutual interest, 
- work together to track legislation relevant to museums"""
session_engagement = """Advocacy can be a scary topic but with this session we intend to present the information in an interactive way that will encourage museum workers at any department/level learn how to participate in advocacy. 

After the panelists do brief presentations we will divide the group into 4 smaller groups to hear ideas from attendees.

We will compile notes from all the groups to share out with attendees."""

**If the thought of advocating every day sounds exhausting, this session will help you approach it from a different angle. At its core, successful advocacy is simply articulating throughout the year why your museum adds value to your community. We will share resources and tools available from state museum associations to help museums of any size advocate for themselves and the field as a whole. All of us have a part in advocating for museums.**
