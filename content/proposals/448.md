Participants will learn about ASTC’s Seeding Action initiative and will be invited to join the Seeding Action Network. Members of the Network receive access to events, expert speakers, adaptable resources, training and opportunities to participate in cross-site projects and evaluation. These resources and opportunities support museums to contribute to a culture shift, moving away from silent concern and inaction–the status quo–toward widespread engagement with solutions involving planetary action.   

Participants will learn about the free app and website iNaturalist, a place where people share their encounters with biodiversity and crowdsource species identifications, as well as discover ways for incorporating it into their work. 
   
Participants will also be invited to apply for free iNaturalist signage with a variety of planetary health messages and grant funding to support the development of an iNaturalist program at their organization."""

This session introduces ASTC’s Seeding Action, which supports museums to cultivate a culture of hope and action to improve planetary health. We will share insights about museums’ planetary health priorities, promising practices, and offer advice to deepen planetary health work. We will also introduce “Seeding Action with iNaturalist,” a project enabling museums to encourage planetary health action. The session also provides the audience opportunity to reflect and discuss their own planetary health understandings and practices.
