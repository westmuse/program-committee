The second objective is to enable seasonsed and emerging professionals to consider and comment on their own experiences utilizing this lens. The third objective is to offer commentary on what the policy and pratical implications would be for such a move towards indigenization.  The fourth objective is to engage the audience in the conversation and to consider its implications for our museum field."""

This roundtable session will bring together four museum professionals currently engaged in decolonization work as they discuss what it means to move towards an indigenization framework. Panelists, who span the gamut from seasoned staff to emerging professionals, will consider a range of questions such as: What is the difference between decolonization and indigenization? Who is engaged in this work? Are there good national or international models? and what are the implications for both museum policy and practice?
