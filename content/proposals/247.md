**This session will highlight the mentorship experiences of four indigenous museum professions who have at various times served as mentors and mentees. What makes a good mentor? What qualities should they have? And when it comes to indigenous staff, are different notions of care involved? Panelists span the gamut from a recent Mellon fellow to a 20+ year museum professional, from a graduate student to the director of a renowned Native American Fellowship program.Â **
