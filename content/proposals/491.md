session_objectives = """The objectives and associated learning outcomes of this session are:
 
1) To introduce conference participants to the new Santa Ynez Chumash Museum and Cultural Center, a museum over 50 years in the making.
 
The desired outcome from this objective is to make the WMA audience aware of this new institution and, more generally, to educate the wider community about the vision driving Tribes to create new collections-based, educational facilities.
 
2) To explore the specific issues driving the project’s development, including: governance, funding, intergovernmental negotiations/approvals, cultural resources protection, conversation & education – including preservation and promotion of Native American Tribal sovereignty, indigenous design & expression at the scales of the site, the buildings, and the interpretive exhibits, and the challenges implicit in the planning, construction (during the pandemic) and start-up of operations for an entirely new institution.
 
The intended outcome for this wide-ranging objective is to provide real-world examples of the types of issues surrounding the development of a new museum for a sovereign Tribe. Each session participant will present different issues of significance based on their role as Museum Director, Museum Board/Tribal Member, and Architect.
 
3) We will welcome the audience’s questions, providing practical, project specific, examples in response. 
 
The anticipated outcome for this objective is to directly engage with the audience and ensure that the session is not perceived as a victory lap, but instead helps other individuals and organizations address both general and specific concerns associated with building a new indigenous institution from the ground up."""
session_engagement = """This will be a typical 3-person session where each presenter will have a slide presentation focusing on the project’s development from their specific role. Each presenter will pose a challenging question to the audience at the beginning of that person’s portion of the session as an example of the type of issues that had to be addressed during the 25 years of active project development. A Q&A session will conclude the presentation."""

Gain the insights from the perspective of a Museum Board & Tribal Member, the Museum Director, and the Architect.
