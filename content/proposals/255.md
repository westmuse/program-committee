**The Museum of Us team in partnership with the Indigenous Maya Consultants will uplift the decolonial process for development and installation of the Maya exhibit, Maya Peoples: Heart of the Sky, Heart of the Earth. During this session the Indigenous Maya consultants and the Museum team members (exhibit/cultural resources/education) will review the steps for how the Indigenous-led and Indigenous directed exhibit came to fruition during the midst of the pandemic and other challenges. The panelist will talk through consultation process, design, script development, themes, consultation with international stakeholders, education curricula development, and trust-building. **
