- Residency program at Stevens-Crawford Heritage House in Oregon City; run by Art in Oregon; I know the two people who run this organization and would ask Tammy Jo Wilson (also an artist) to come speak. https://artinoregon.org/2021/03/18/stevens-crawford-house-artist-residency/ 
- Residency program run at the Portland City Archives: I know people at the Regional Arts & Culture Council and also could ask the artist featured in this article, Sabina Haque. She has spoken on other panels (experience with public speaking) and we have corresponded. https://www.portlandoregon.gov/archives/article/575419 
- Tacoma Museum of Glass: https://www.museumofglass.org/visiting-artist-lineup2021; I know Katie Buckingham, Curator through collaboration with WaMA, but haven't asked her about this.
- Burke Museum: https://www.burkemuseum.org/northwest-native-art-gallery/artist-studio.
- The Sitka Center for Art & Ecology partners with the Oregon State University Hatfield Marine Science Center for a residency on an ocean vessel. I have corresponded with the ED of Sitka, Alison Dennis and could ask her who might be a good rep. https://www.sitkacenter.org/residencies/artist-at-sea-residency 
- I'm a huge fan of the residency programs at the Exploratorium in SF, but don't know who to contact there."""

This session explores the breadth and depth of artist-in-residence programs at museums. Artists bring a wealth of knowledge, creativity and unique perspectives to the museum experience - whether they are invited to explore the collection, benefit from a unique space, or share their creations with visitors. They can activate spaces, reveal new truths and engage fresh audiences. In this panel, a brief overview of artist-in-residency programs will be provided, and then a panel of professionals and museums will share their stories, experience and advice. Key takeaways include the benefits of inviting artists into the museum, learning about the variety of models out there, and tips on implementing an artist-in-residency program at your institution.
