As a space to facilitate informal learning and dialogue about historical and contemporary issues, JANM’s strength–like other museums–is its ability to interpret the past to inform the present and future. Various technologies are critical to furthering this work. JANM is experimenting with technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality to make the artifacts in the permanent collection–and the stories hinged to them–more accessible to a broader audience. As a result of experimenting with these technologies and incorporating them into its exhibitions and educational programs, JANM can share the lessons learned with other forward thinking institutions."""

As the Nisei (American-born Japanese) reach the twilight of their lives, memory of the World War II experience will soon be lost. The Japanese American National Museum (JANM) and nonprofit Japanese American Stories are working with Storyfile to use artificial intelligence to create an experience that will enable visitors to have a conversation with an avatar of a Japanese American World War II veteran for years to come. Session attendees will have the opportunity to experience this forward-thinking technology.
