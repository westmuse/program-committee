Learn how to create a responsive program - a term to describe events created in response to visitor needs and behaviors. Rather than solely creating programs born from the museum's initiatives, responsive programs - whether about wellness, activism, or access - center visitor engagement.

Attendees will participate in a short responsive program, hear examples from SAM, LACMA, and The Huntington, then engage in a workshop to create a responsive program for their organizations.
