  Making Museums a place for healing, and a place for addressing, processing, healing, etc. from trauma as a part of the museum experiences.
Trauma is nothing new, but something that is being discussed more and more. Museums may trigger trauma for some people in ways we don’t realize or expect, so can we address this, prepare for it, and maybe even make museums a new space for recovery?
