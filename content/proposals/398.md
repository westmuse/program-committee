While developing a community collaborative exhibit at the Arizona State Museum, Tohono O'odham community curators were drawn to storytelling as a way of recognizing identity. Initial conversations kept returning to truth-telling and the stories we tell ourselves as Native individuals, and members of a larger community. This led us to continuously ask, "but is that real?" This session will share the process of developing an exhibit for a mostly non-native audience, while focusing on our truths.
