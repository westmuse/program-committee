Have you ever been the only\_\_\_\_\_ in the room? (black, white, Asian, Native, Male, Female, Gay, Straight, Young, Old, Differently Abled, Etc.)
A conversation focusing on how we sometimes miss out on understanding one another, because we may not have seen, experienced, and/or realized things from others perspective. A dialog about museums from different perspectives.
