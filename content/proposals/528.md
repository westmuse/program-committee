Sinyohow Haawaakm 'Aaknach is Barona Cultural Center & Museum’s latest film in our ancient philosophy series. This 20-minute animated film explains from where our cultural protocols come. Sinyohow, the woman who knows all, raises her twin boys, who are also all-knowing, but despite this, they struggle with motherhood and growing up. Even though this is an ancient story, it remains relevant today! See the film and learn about the importance of modern story-telling!
