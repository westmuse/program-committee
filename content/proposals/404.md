Creative Aging programs are gaining momentum! Join us for a hands-on workshop led by LACMA teaching artists, where we will focus on advocacy tools and shared knowledge from our program Create+Collaborate. We will delve into tour strategies, community building, and art-making with older adults. Our discussion will cover a range of engagement approaches and accommodations for viewing artworks and engaging in art-making with this growing, yet underserved population.
