Barona Cultural Center & Museum proudly offers a screening of their new, 20-minute film, Nya'waap Illyuw Uuchyuwp--Our Way of Knowing, the Kumeyaay People's Creation Story.  Remove your Western lens.  Sit back, munch on popcorn, and be transported to an evening under the stars, around the campfire, listening to the story as it had been told for countless generations.  After, let's discuss ways to find space in your museum to foster empathy for Native perspectives.
