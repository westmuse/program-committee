session_objectives = """This session is meant to raise an important topic that can touch on many of the most significant social and cultural issues of our time.  What for some visitors may seem high-stakes or high-risk, may for others be a welcome challenge. What does it mean to encourage museum visitors, especially kids, to take risks in museums? Should we create exhibits and encourage interactions that help visitors develop decision-making and risk-assessment skills?
 
Attendees will have access to these concrete takeaways:
·      We will do a series of exercises showing how to discuss risk with museum staff, and discuss the facilitation of the discussion. Attendees then can take these exercises back and facilitate them with their teams. 
·      Each panel member will bring an example of an exhibit where anticipated (or unanticipated) risks played out in the design, programming or ongoing use. We will provide a handout summarizing those exhibits. 
·      Table discussions will include a wide range of considerations including Defining Risk, as Risk looks very different to different people and Museums
o  Risk and Danger
o  Risk in discussion of politics and social issues 
o  Ricky vs scary – be clear about the difference
o  The book “50 Dangerous Things…” and its origin
o  Risk for adults vs for kids, and family risk taking
o  Risk to donors, or to the donor relationship"""
session_engagement = """This session will engage a diverse panel of museum professionals, and will allow a significant amount of interaction among participants. Panelists will ask a series of interactive questions, allowing real-time on-screen voting. 
 
Attendees will be encouraged to think about how play, emotional engagement, parenting, controversial topics, scientific discoveries, and issues of gender, social justice and access might provide the context for experiences that visitors may see as posing a physical, emotional or intellectual challenge. We will discuss what makes an exhibit seem “risky” and what the “stakes” might be for visitors engaging with these exhibits."""

2.     Assess decisions related to how other museums grapple with, and ultimately take on, the idea of risk.
3.     Be inspired by examples of exhibits, programs and installations that allow visitors (and staff) to take risks in the museum environment."""

There are also always-evolving expectations with regard to the "tough topics" with which society is grappling."""

 Also, if the WMA program committee is interested in this topic, we will invite 2 more presenters to be part of the main fishbowl panel, and then have an "open chair" format so that others who are exploring this issue in their museums can join.

  Risk-taking is an important part of human development, and can lead to significant learning opportunities in museums.  Risks are also important to consider in leadership, capital campaigns and community engagement. Risks available to visitors may be physical, emotional or intellectual, and perception of that risk depends on context. In this session, museum staff, board members and designers will examine the role of risk in the museum environment. We’ll consider the power – and pitfalls – of integrating active play, controversial topics, scientific discoveries, and issues like gender, social justice and inclusion into exhibit design and programs.
