session_unique = """Most people default to transactional ways of relating to each other and that prevents innovative work in many areas of the museum. This takes a decolonial approach without spelling it out."""
session_objectives = """The main learning objective is being able to tell the difference between a transactional framework (which involves the translation of someone’s value, often time, into dollar amounts) and a reciprocal framework (one in which value is co-defined and relationships exist beyond a specific project or context) for relationships. This seemingly minor difference can have a profound impact on how people experience the relationship, and what is possible as a result of the relationship.   
 
Another learning objective beyond understanding the definitional differences, is identifying how it shows up in practice. This will be done through story-sharing to highlight ways we accidentally default to transaction. Stories of strife in relationships will be highlighted in terms of transaction, and participants will support each other in highlighting how to develop reciprocity in novel ways. 
 
Lastly, a couple practical tips that can be used to encourage relationships towards reciprocity rather than transaction. These tips will be revealed through story of the participants most rewarding relationships both internally in the museum and externally with collaborators, community groups, and the public.  

We are developing a small group/partner activity to encourage people to analyze how to make relationships more reciprocal, but an extensive Q+A section is also possible if people want to understand ways in which this focus on relationship is decolonial by nature. Overall, we will lean on sharing stories from the presenters and then the audience to highlight the importance of reciprocal relationships, making sure that there is a particular focus on internal relationships with other co-workers (people will default to community relationships)."""
session_engagement = """One facilitator is Indigenous, and the other an educator. We will use a combination of story-sharing and facilitated small-group conversation to co-learn what the difference between reciprocal and transactional relationships is, and how that impacts what is possible, and how it feels to be in relationship with each other. It will start with (very) brief story-sharing from the facilitators, then people volunteering in the large group, and then an activity for people to do in small groups or in pairs to share stories and explore this idea personally."""
session_scalability = """It only requires that people form relationships to other people, internally or externally, so is applicable to all organization types and sizes. It even applies to organizations of 1 person, because museums inherently work with the public too.

**What is the difference between reciprocity and transaction? This session explores how these approaches to developing relationships can effect everything from the project planning, community engagement, to staff satisfaction. **
