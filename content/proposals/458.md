**Through the summer of 2025, WMA members will convene virtually to share, discuss, debate and determine their approaches to America 250. Based on these rich virtual dialogues, the WMA Programs and Innovation Committee will provide key takeaways and materials created to continue the conversation through an engaging and interactive conference session building upon last year’s initial informational session.**
