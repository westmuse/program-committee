**Running a day camp is not for the faint of heart – there’s a lot that goes into planning a safe and successful program! Camps offer many things to organizations and their communities – from building deep, sustained engagement from youth participants and their families to a childcare solution for parents. This session will allow professionals to dig into what it takes to care for youth in a museum camp program, from curriculum to registration and beyond.**
