session_objectives = """Museum studies programs cover a wide range of vital topics, from collections management to visitor studies, and from exhibit design to educational programming. But many of the behind the scenes activities that are critical to running a small museum are not covered in these academic programs. In small museums, all of the operations are the responsibility of a few or, in some cases, just a single staff member. Liability insurance, payroll, HR regulations, IRS reporting, not to mention the practicalities of how your facility works. And who among us has not plunged a clogged toilet at our museum during a busy event? In this session, a panel of small museum directors will uncover what our museum studies programs didn’t teach us about running our museums. Rather than being a knock on our alma maters, the focus will be on the practical, day to day issues that arise, and how we have learned to manage them. 
Outcome 1: Attendees will learn how other people in similar positions have addressed similar issues
Outcome 2: Attendees will learn that they are not alone in the issues they face. There is strength in understanding that other people face the same challenges.
Outcome 3: Attendees will connect with colleagues, creating networks of small museum professionals they can rely on in the future"""

**While we loved our museum studies courses, there are just some things our alma maters didn’t teach us. Small museum directors must be jacks-of-all-trades, and the education we received in school didn’t _quite _prepare us for what we encounter on a daily basis. A panel of small museum directors will lead a lively discussion about what we’ve had to learn on the job and invite audience members to share their hard earned lessons.**
