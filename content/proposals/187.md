School outreach is an important part of engaging students who may never visit your institution, but can be fraught with logistical challenges. Get inspired to update, expand, or implement your school outreach program by hearing from a panel of museum educators with local, regional, and statewide outreach programs.	 Topics of discussion will include scheduling, scalability, accessibility, addressing school standards, and staffing, as well as Q&A time.
