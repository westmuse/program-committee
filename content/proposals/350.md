Meet us at the observation deck tonight to stargaze with us.  Learn about Kumeyaay constellations, try to spot them, and make your own star guide.  See how Kumeyaay People were expert timekeepers using their star knowledge.  These star guides can be adapted for use in your area and are a great way to incorporate Native knowledge into your programming.
