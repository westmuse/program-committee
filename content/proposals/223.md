Objective #2:  Land acknowledgments have their roots in Judeo-Christian theology, that "man" has dominion over the land and all living things.  The Western world perceives land as a commodity, something that can be owned.  This is counter-intuitive in the way many First American communities view the world.  Land is not a commodity, but rather people belong to the land, not the other way around.

Objective #3:  Land Acknowledgements are just words unless accompanied by action. Consider how your group, business or organization can support First American communities and individuals through volunteering, awareness or material support."""

More and more museums, higher learning institutions, government entities, and organizations are adopting “land acknowledgements” to recognize indigenous populations associated with specific geographic areas.  While the intent is noble, land acknowledgments can be problematic in unintended ways.  This session will explore the benefits and pitfalls in creating land acknowledgments.  Panelists will discuss the process and challenges of developing land acknowledgments for their respective institutions.
