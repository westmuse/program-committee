**Recent executive orders have changed the landscape of arts organizations. Funding sources, grant institutions, research and community representation have all been impacted. You - the audience - are the panel for this moderated discussion. Please come ready to share how your museum or organization is responding to policy changes, and addressing challenges we are all facing. This conversation will leverage the strength of the WMA community to build collective resilience for the communities we serve. **
