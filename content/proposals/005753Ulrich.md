description: "Do you have insufficient artifacts in your museum’s collection for an upcoming exhibition or grand re-opening? Where can they be obtained given your limited resources and time? Loans are common transactions for many museums, but how are they negotiated? This session will convey methodology and advice for effective diplomacy to obtain critical object loans and donations from other institutions and private sources. Also discussed will be the long and short term advantages making these arrangements affords."
uniqueness: "The presentation will offer guidance to use a variety of channels to attain necessary resources that permit the curation of representative, compelling exhibitions."
objectives: "The session will seek to impart a comprehension of how to make the most of a museum’s resources that can be employed to fulfill its curatorial aims. Introduce what a museum needs to provide to assure different kinds of museums to entrust their objects as a loan.

How to identify and find leads to locate potential sources. Understanding the means of diplomatically soliciting the loan or donation for the exhibition. Understand how to assuage an owner’s potential conditions or concerns regarding the transaction while respecting with the capabilities, capacity, and integrity of your institution. 

Comprehend the value of exercising these resources and how it benefits your museum in the long and short runs—creating new stakeholders, adding to the collection, expanding your serving the public well with thorough displays in your exhibitions.
"
engagement: "This Standard Session Format will begin with introductions. Then Speaker #1 will share their respective experiences and wisdom, followed by Speaker #2. Hand-outs will be distributed identifying helpful resources and what a museum should have to make them a worthy candidate for a loan to a person or institution that is a stranger to them. A role playing exercise may occur with some attendees acting as a prospective borrower approaching another taking the persona of an object’s owner or custodian. (75 minutes in length)"
additional_comments: "Yes I will need help finding presenters. I am willing to moderate, but open to having 
another fellow museum professional do so. I think three people is a great number to have up there. I think two presenters and a moderator ideal.

Yes I am willing to merge with another session if necessary; however, I believe this topic stands alone and there are a lot of different experiences that curators can share regarding it.

theme_relationship: "The session is designed to inspire museum professionals and advocates to engage their colleagues near and far, partners, board, stakeholders, and make new stakeholders out of previously unaffiliated parties and individuals to coordinate a successful attempt to acquire artifacts, especially rare or elusive ones, sought by their institution. When these objects are acquired through loan, purchase, or donation they can make the museum exhibition more engaging to visitors."
