session_objectives = """1) The intended audience for this session includes any museums professional who wishes to engage in inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility work, whether in a large progressive city or a conservative small town. Based discussion in small breakout groups, audience members will develop their own ideas about how to bring more inclusive practices and audience engagement techniques to museums of all sizes, disciplines, and geographic locations. Participants should glean at least a couple of concrete ideas that they could try to implement in their museum. 2) Participants will develop a sense of community and shared purpose by meeting other professionals who are struggling with the very same challenges of how to engage in diversity, equity, accessibility and inclusion work when they are being told by their boss or their board that they can’t do anything partisan at work, anything that takes a stance on a particular issue, or sometimes, even express an opinion outside of work. By growing their network, participants will gain new resources to call upon when they are back in their museum and encounter a challenge when trying to advance inclusion in their institution. 3) By going beyond the foundational concept that no organization or person is neutral, the session will investigate the contrasting realities faced by museum professionals from big cities to small towns, progressive bubbles to conservative strongholds. Participants and presenters will expand the conversation popularized by movements such as #museumsarenotneutral and #museumsarequietlysubversive to explore the tensions in their own institutions and the field at large.  """
session_engagement = """Moderator will ask presenters one question; presenters will each have 5 minutes to answer. Moderator will then pose two open-ended questions to the audience, as them to break up into groups of 5-6, and spend 30 minutes discussing those questions before reconvening and reporting out to the full audience for the final 30 minutes.  Takeaways will include: 1. A reading list (exact titles TBD) 2. Compilation of notes from each of the breakout groups. """
