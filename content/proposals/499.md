session_objectives = """Collections Assessment: Participants will learn why a collections assessment is a crucial best practice. We will explain what a collections assessment should involve, including who should be engaged from your organization (both collections managers and facilities operators). This session will highlight the dialog and coordination needed between in-house collections stewards, consulting collections specialists, facilities managers and operators, and specialized collections planning consultants. We will also define where to start, best practices for the process, and offer advice on schedule and budget.
  
Cost: In addition to forming the core of the mission of a museum, collections comprise the organization’s greatest risk due to their financial value. Planning for their care takes sensitivity, expertise, and acknowledgement of the financial needs of their care. Participants will learn about the costs involved in building and maintaining collections facilities, as well as advise on how to budget for a collections planning project in addition to describing the costs of implementation.
  
The Connection between your collections and your facility: No collections project can be performed in a silo. During this roundtable-style session, participants will learn about the coordination necessary between assessing your collection and evaluating your current building conditions. We will showcase pitfalls and highlight methods of stewardship at multiple scales."""

session_scalability = """Neither organization type or size, nor collection type and size funding will affect the learning outcomes of the session. We will address all scales and all forms of collections projects.
