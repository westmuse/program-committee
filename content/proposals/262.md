session_objectives = """Utilizing teen volunteers in a small museum setting can provide numerous benefits to both the museum and the community. 

First objective is enhancing visitor experience. Teen volunteers can help to enhance the visitor experience by providing enthusiastic and knowledgeable tours. This can create a more engaging and interactive experience for visitors, making them more likely to return and recommend the museum to others, especially families. Teen volunteers can also provide a fresh perspective and youthful energy to the museum, making it a more dynamic and exciting place to visit.
 
Second objective is building community connections. By engaging teen volunteers from the local community, the museum can build stronger connections with the community. This can create a sense of ownership and investment among local youth, leading to increased attendance and support from the community. Teen volunteers can also serve as ambassadors for the museum, helping to spread the word about its exhibits and events.
 
Last objective is developing career skills. Utilizing teen volunteers can provide valuable work experience and career skills for young people. By offering training and guidance in areas such as customer service, public speaking, and museum operations, the museum can help prepare teens for future careers in a variety of fields. This can benefit both the teens and the museum by creating a pool of skilled and knowledgeable young people who may be interested in pursuing careers in museums or related fields. Overall, utilizing teen volunteers in a small museum setting can provide numerous benefits, including enhancing the visitor experience, building community connections, and developing career skills for young people."""
session_engagement = """This presentation would provide opportunities for questions and discussion, as well as examples that demonstrate effective strategies for engaging and supporting teen volunteers in museums. Handouts outlining key takeaways, examples, and best practices will be provided. The presentation will also provide opportunities for networking and collaboration amongst attendees."""
session_scalability = """The outcomes from the proposed session on utilizing teen volunteers in a small museum can apply to multiple organization types and sizes in the museum field in several ways. 

First, the strategies and resources needed for engaging teen volunteers can be adapted to fit the needs and resources of different museums. For example, smaller museums may need to rely more heavily on volunteers and may need to provide more training and support, while larger museums may have more resources to devote to volunteer programs.
 
Second, the benefits of utilizing teen volunteers, such as enhancing the visitor experience and building community connections, are relevant to all types and sizes of museums. Whether a museum is large or small, it can benefit from the enthusiasm and energy of young volunteers who can provide a fresh perspective and help to engage visitors, especially families.
 
Finally, the session can provide a framework for developing effective volunteer programs that can be adapted to fit the needs of different types and sizes of museums. By sharing best practices and case studies from successful volunteer programs, this session can help museums of all sizes develop effective strategies for engaging teen volunteers and enhancing their museum experience.
