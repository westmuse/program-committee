Cultural planning provides a process for collaborating across sectors and ensuring that museums better meet community needs and deepen their community impact by identifying high-level priorities. This session will focus on how cultural plans benefit from museums as leaders in the planning process, how museums benefit from participating in cultural plans, and how planning across institutions deepens impact for all museums in an ecosystem.
