In 2026, the United States will commemorate 250 years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence. What does that mean for museums in the West? Are Indigenous, Black, Asian, Pacific Islander, Latino/a/x and other stories of communities often left out of history books being told? Might this be an opportunity to share them? Attendees are invited to share their perspectives, recommendations, and engage in conversation around museums and the commemoration.
