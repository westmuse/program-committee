Intentional choices must be made to balance priorities and resources related to the broad work of IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility).  Boise Art Museum will share a case study, with touchable and tangible samples, of their four-year journey to assess its practices and to create new interpretive initiatives and affordances to increase access and inclusion, in an effort to welcome people who are blind, deaf, or neuro-diverse.
