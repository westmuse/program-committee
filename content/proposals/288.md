session_objectives = """There are three critical learning outcomes that we intend to cover.

Learning Outcome #1: What is AI?

We will provide clear, accessible definitions of different types of AI and how they relate to the museum field.

Learning Outcome #2: How can museums use AI?

We will discuss museum-specific examples that directly connect to the important work of countless museum experts. We will look at these areas of interest:

Education & Interpretation
Membership & Development
Operations & Infrastructure
Exhibitions & Collection
Communications & Marketing
Research & Curatorial
Exhibitions & Programming
Audience Experience & Design

We want to show how all disciplines can be accelerated with the help of AI.


Learning Outcome #3: What resources are there for museum professionals to continue to learn and interact with AI?

We will provide easy-to-access resources so that attendees have opportunities to engage with AI and introduce it into their day-to-day work."""
session_engagement = """Following an AI primer and a brief interaction with a text and an image AI generator to establish a baseline of understanding, we will use real-world examples as prompts to spark a collaborative discussion with the audience about the opportunities and challenges presented by the emergence of AI. We will conclude with a set of resources for museum professionals to embrace the technology and begin to apply it to their own professional interests."""
session_scalability = """AI will have a significant and profound impact on museums of all types and sizes. Arguably, smaller museums can reap the greatest benefit from the appropriate use of AI. AI will affect: 

- Collections Management: AI can assist museums in managing their collections by analyzing large amounts of data, such as object descriptions, provenance, and historical context. 

- Visitor Engagement: AI can enhance visitor engagement by providing personalized recommendations, interpretation, and interactive experiences. 

- Conservation and Preservation: AI can help museums identify potential conservation issues in their collections. AI can analyze images of artifacts to detect signs of damage or deterioration. AI can also help museums monitor environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, to prevent damage to artifacts.

- Marketing and Audience Development: AI can help museums understand their audience better and develop targeted marketing strategies.

- Operations and Administration: AI can create and tailor any number and types of administrative documents and provide information about policies, practices, guidelines, standards, etc. 

Regardless of a museum's size, budget, and collection/exhibition focus, AI offers numerous benefits to all museums, from streamlining operations and enhancing visitor experiences to improving collections management and development efforts.

AI is a reality. It could be our greatest asset for interpretation and education, or it could undermine our authority. Ask AI how it can help museums, it will say enhanced visitor experience and improved and tailored education. This session is both AI primer and a discussion about how museums can use AI across all disciplines (operations, exhibitions) and all formats (text, audio, video) to improve day-to-day work and grow and enhance the visitor experience.
