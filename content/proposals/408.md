session_objectives = """Journaling’s focus on process over product creates space for learning and reflection. In this workshop participants will gain
-an introduction to nature journaling, a practice that can be adopted by anyone interested in their natural surroundings.
-a deeper understanding of species diversity and geology of the Sonoran desert through species identification and observation. 
-and a renewed spirit through connection to the landscape and material art making.

The workshop will provide a model for how participants might incorporate journaling into self-care activities for staff or in public programming activities at their own institutions. The activity is applicable to all ages and abilities.

Participants will explore perceptual acuity, material handling, and taxonomy while drawing from life and reference materials. Because we will be working within the landscaped area of the Ventana Canyon Resort within the Sonoran Desert, we will provide reference materials that can be used during the workshop. Participants will later be able to use their self-made resources and journaling skills on their own self guided desert walks."""
session_engagement = """All participants will actively engage in making and, as they choose, dialogue.  

The outdoor area of the resort appears suitable. Tables and chairs will be needed. A maximum number of 18 participants will be possible, dependent upon available tables and chairs/ space. We will provide pencils, pens, paints, paper, palettes, water receptacles, reference materials. We will work with resort staff to source water and clean up. All materials will be washable."""
session_scalability = """This workshop could be adapted to emphasize the art aspect,  the natural science aspect, or be altered slightly to highlight history- in this way it can apply to many types of museums. It is a point of return for us and we think it will be for participants as well. It is a means for participants to regain momentum and remind themselves how to think like an artist, how to think like a naturalist with the goal of bringing this creativity back to our museums, to our work.

Caring for visitors, collections objects, and our staff are the primary goals of many museum professionals. This workshop will be an opportunity to reconnect with caring for ourselves— learning about desert flora and fauna through observation and nature journaling. Participants will leave with a deeper connection to the landscape, an understanding of species diversity and geology of the Sonoran desert, and new friends. 
All levels of art and naturalist expertise are welcome.
