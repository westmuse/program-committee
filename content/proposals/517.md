Three years in the making, Hawaiʻi Triennial 2025 opened in the months following the US presidential election. Forty nine artists and artist collectives from Hawaiʻi, the Pacific, and beyond engaged deeply with the theme of Aloha Nō. Exploring themes of love, loss, grief, transnational sovereignty, colonization and commercialization in 14 venues on 3 islands, HT25 ultimately spoke of healing and transformation.  One of the most impactful installations was the ʻUmeke Laʻau, a 22 foot in diameter calabash. This session will engage with one of the curators of HT25, Noelle Kahanu, and artist Meleanna Meyer.
