We would like to show a few short films made by participants in the program so a projector and screen are needed. We plan to include a brief writing activity where we ask the audience to write down their immediate associations with the word “veteran.” We will fold these responses into our presentation and revisit them later on during the Knowledge Café portion. The audience will have time to brainstorm ways to engage veterans at their museums and share these with the group.
