Wear your favorite museum-themed T-shirt on the second day of the conference.  Each conference attendee will be given a ticket in their registration packet to give to the wearer of the best t-shirt (wearers should be prepared to talk about their shirts!).  Participants who have received ten or more tickets can redeem them for prizes at the WMA registration desk at the end of the day.
