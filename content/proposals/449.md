By showcasing real-world examples through fast-paced PechaKucha presentations, attendees will gain inspiration from museums that have successfully implemented climate-driven experiences to mobilize their audiences.
Through facilitated roundtable discussions, participants will identify opportunities to apply these ideas in their own institutions, regardless of size or focus. They will explore strategies for incorporating community partnerships, hands-on engagement, and locally relevant climate narratives to drive action. These discussions will help attendees navigate challenges, share resources, and develop new ideas for making climate education both impactful and accessible.
By the end of the session, participants will leave with a clearer understanding of how to engage their communities in meaningful climate conversations through museum experiences. Whether through exhibit design, educational programming, or sustainability initiatives, attendees will gain actionable strategies to create locally relevant climate engagement efforts that inspire change."""
