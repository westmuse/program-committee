Everyone will hear how other Museums think about data differently. We will also provide suggestions of public data sources that are available to tap into for free.
2.      Define measurable objectives.
3.      Construct a Project Goal that uses measurable objectives and tells a compelling story for a funder.
4.      Use clear statements in funding proposals to set up your museum for success once funding is approved."""

**This session will encourage participants to develop clear goals and objectives for funding proposals using data they are already collecting. We will answer the question “What story can I tell with this data?” Participants will receive tips for collecting data and understanding which data to use when setting project objectives. Participants will walk away having written a clear narrative ready to plug in data when they return to their Museum. **
