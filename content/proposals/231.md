Museums are facing unprecedented challenges – and opportunities – to engage with their communities in new and innovative ways. But what makes for successful community engagement and how can we adapt to ensure our strategies remain meaningful and relevant despite limitations posed by the COVID pandemic? This session will highlight the experiences of recent Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) grant recipients with community-focused projects and share lessons learned for future practitioners.
