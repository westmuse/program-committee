You have conducted an inventory of your collections and now have a pile of objects with no identification, how to proceed? This roundtable will provide a time to discuss procedures to locate identities. Though each state has its own laws governing found in collections items, the processes and procedures of trying to locate an item’s identification can be similar. Let’s share ideas, struggles, and provide support for each other as we tackle this giant puzzle.
