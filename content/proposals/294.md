Session would share the journey of how the Santa Ynez Chumash Museum & Cultural Center came into being – from the ideas and vision tribal leadership and elders held long ago through the journey of the development, construction, and coordination of bringing the Chumash People together to turn this dream into a reality.  As an important historical site for the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians, session would explore how the Chumash People continue to be caretakers and fulfill cultural responsibility to preserve the stories and cultural items related to the site and the experience of Chumash life.
