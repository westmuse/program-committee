description: "Gather round the (artificial) campfire as we swap unimaginable but true tales of museum craft, such as:
•Spine tingling tales about human resources practices! (The HR in HoRRor!)
•Devilish stories of development (You can take it with you? Unplanned giving?)
•Creepy collections management! (Tales from the Crypt)
•Astonishing Legends of Early Learning (the infected! Night of the living germs!)
Learn from those who have lived to tell these tales…..and share your own if you dare!
