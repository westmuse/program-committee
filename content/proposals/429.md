**A discussion of the learning opportunities and challenges of creating and implementing a new integrated pest management plan. Starting from scratch, Laura conceptualized how to define pests as separate from incidentals; how to track pests; and how to quantify changes in pest appearances. Laura will share resources and tools gathered on her journey.**
