Consider how do we can be in community with our stakeholders. Explore the challenges and opportunities this change in paradigm creates.

Attendees will develop adaptable pop-up exhibit plans and programming, creating scalable strategies that museums, libraries, and cultural institutions can tailor to their specific and unique resources, audience needs, and outreach goals.

This session is perfect for curators (history, science, art, anthro etc), museum educators, museum exhibit developers, museum mangers, museum leadership."""

How do you meet your community? Pop-up exhibits and programs at community sites are one way to take museum expertise and resources to the community, and develop sustainable long-term relationships with the community. Hear how museums are bringing people together at community watering holes to engage with curators, educators, exhibit planners, culture bearers, scientists and artists. With colleagues plan your own pop-up exhibit or interactive program.

_Note: There is the possibility of expanding the session to develop a WMA pop-up exhibit, which would be shared with and added to by conference attendants throughout the conference._
