Innovation hubs like San Francisco and Seattle are hotbeds for the latest technology. Innovation is ingrained into the culture, but to what degree does your community expect your museum to keep up with the latest tech? At what level does your institution need to engage to stay relevant? And if not, does that make you obsolete? Join us for a pro and con debate on the decades old question of keeping up with the Joneses.
