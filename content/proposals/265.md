session_objectives = """Attendees who work in a variety of capacities at art museums with affiliated outdoor spaces (gardens, estates, city parks, sculpture parks, etc.) will connect with colleagues with similar types of outdoor resources. While botanical gardens and public parks have organizations dedicated to fostering community among professionals, art museums do not; thus this presentation will spur the creation of a new network to inform and improve the use of outdoor spaces across art museums. 

Participants in the roundtable discussion will learn alternative approaches and innovative ideas by sharing institutional practices, program concepts, and lessons learned. 

The session will consider new questions and models via prompting by the facilitators and evaluate these models for their own sites via conversation and exchange. 

Through this discussion, participants will create a network of museum staff who utilize outdoor spaces for audience engagement and bring ideas back to their institutions. 

Other questions we will address in this session include:  How can art museums ensure outdoor activities and spaces promote deeper connections between visitors and their institutions? 
How can approaches to staffing, interpretation, or programming be scaled to suit the museum’s resources? 
How can engagement and mission be centered even as an institution leverages the revenue-generating possibilities of outdoor spaces? 
What can art museums learn from other sectors and types of institutions? 
How can museums best acknowledge the complex histories of the land on which the institutional outdoor spaces sit, including centering the Indigenous peoples who continue to steward and have a relationship with the site?"""
session_engagement = """The facilitators will each share a case study. Then participants will select a topic to explore in groups: 1) Interpretation; 2) Marketing and Communication; 3) Staffing; and 4) Programs. During group conversations, participants will surface challenges, opportunities, and innovative ways of working with outdoor spaces, planting seeds for ongoing conversation. The groups will share to conclude the session and contact information will be distributed among participants to foster a community among museums with outdoor spaces."""

This roundtable discussion will foster dialogue related to art museums with affiliated outdoor spaces (landscape settings, sculpture gardens, or parks). Focused breakout discussions will consider how to ensure that outdoor space use promotes deeper connections with visitors, staffing, interpretation, and programming practices, the potential for revenue, and how museums can acknowledge the histories of the land on which our outdoor spaces sit, including centering Indigenous peoples.
