session_objectives = """- Participants will better understand the foundational mindsets and mental models of liberatory, community-centered, and regenerative systems change
- Participants will gain practical experiences with tools and processes that operationalize equity in their organization including but not limited to the following
    - Reckon with and formulate problems of practice related to their context; 
    - Understand why we should create space to hear the stories and lived experiences of the community; 
    - Learn and practice empathy interviews as a way to center and amplify these stories/experiences; 
    - Experience ways to analyze and incorporate empathy data; 
    - Engage in a root cause analysis to understand contextual problems more deeply; 
    - And co-create equitable and inclusive solutions to these root causes.
- Participants will also learn strategies and models of how to build capacity  in their organization and beyond for liberatory, community-centered change"""
session_engagement = """We believe participants learn by doing so all of our facilitation involves participants engaging in the actual tools and processes of community-centered design. The following are some ways participants will engage:
- Small groups: develop problems of practice
- Small group discussion: observe a model empathy interview with guiding discussion questions  
- Pairs: Practice empathy interviews with a partner 
- Team collaboration: develop a root cause analysis (poster paper and sticky notes)
- Partners and small groups: Reimagine current systems"""
