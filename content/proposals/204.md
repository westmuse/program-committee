This session focuses on a student-driven exhibition at the Center for Creative Photography (CCP), University of Arizona. In Fall 2022, a graduate-level art education course will inhabit the CCP's new interdisciplinary gallery to design and implement an exhibition from the CCP’s collection of color photography and focused on community-centered practices. The session discusses the class-residency collaboration from the perspective of the student, faculty, and museum professional as it is in progress.
