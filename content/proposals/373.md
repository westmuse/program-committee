·      About types of equipment and online platforms used to create AR.
·      How to do 3D scans of objects and edit the files.
·      About basics of hologram creation.
·      How to create QR codes or triggers for starting the AR experience.  
·      About design language and considerations for signage and advertising.
The workshop will close with guided small group conversations to start planning for participants’ own AR projects."""

We will provide AR technology equipment, but will need strong wifi and an LCD projector. Attendees may want to bring their own laptops or tablets (optional) and their smartphones. (If no LCD projector is available, I may be able to borrow one.)"""

Mystified by what is Augmented Reality (AR) and how to use it at your institution? Join us to learn how to harness the techniques of AR to bring your exhibits to life! During the workshop you will scan objects to make 3D files, learn about equipment and editing files, become familiar with basics of hologram creation, learn to create QR codes or triggers for starting the AR experience, consider signage design, and discuss planning your own AR projects.
