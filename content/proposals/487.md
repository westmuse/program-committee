2. Establishing Effective D&I goals: A common challenge in the D&I space is establishing specific and achievable goals. By working together, we believe that all session attendees will have a better understanding of how to establish effective goals relating to D&I work.
3. Modelling a D&I workshop that effectively engages stakeholders: Attendees will learn best practices for hosting their own D&I world café sessions with stakeholders."""

Join us for a feedback session on how to ELEVATE WMA’s D&I practices! The newly-formed WMA D&I Committee wants our work to be informed by the people we serve, so we're hosting an input-gathering session on what we hope to achieve together. We will discuss the role of DEIA in museums, how WMA can help, actionable goals, and more. Attendees will provide input that will guide the D&I direction of WMA for years to come.
