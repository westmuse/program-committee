As the United States approaches its 250th anniversary, museums play a crucial role in fostering reflection, dialogue, and engagement. This session explores innovative programming strategies through two distinct, complementary exhibits: _Centuries of Celebration: America’s 1876 & 1976 Milestones_ and _America’s Other Founders: Survival, Struggle, and Strength. _
The session will focus on collaboration with community partners, strategies for enhancing visitor engagement, and approaches to ensuring historical narratives are inclusive, accurate, and thought-provoking.
