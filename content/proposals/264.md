Artists Myisha Arellano and Michelle Glass will share the community engagement process of _Interwoven Stories_, a "quilted" mural created in collaboration with over 200 Pasadena-area community members over the past year. The 150-square-foot mural was created during public workshops in partnership with Armory Center for the Arts, NAACP Pasadena, Pasadena Community Job Center, Day One, Rose City High School, Community Arms, and the Hastings Branch Library. This project was initiated as part of the Artist at Work national program modeled after the WPA.
