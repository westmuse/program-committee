**Our museums need positive and equitable cultures to thrive. Staff cultures that prioritize personal well-being and engagement can improve institutional impact, employee retention, and overall success, yet many museums rely on outdated HR practices. Letâ€™s work together to build organizations where the humans inside are valued and respected. Join us for philosophical discussions and practical takeaways to ELEVATE museum workplace culture for the benefit of museum staff and the communities they serve.**
