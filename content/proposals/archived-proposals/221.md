Tribal consultation, employed by museums as a NAGPRA requirement over thirty years ago, has expanded to include all forms of cultural heritage including archival material. Tribes and museums routinely expect it. However, the actual implementation of consultation remains challenging based on the continued lack of understanding of relationship building. Panelists will discuss lessons learned and issues related to the return of digital records that impact reparative language, metadata and search terms.
