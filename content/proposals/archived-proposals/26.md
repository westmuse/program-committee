Museum education demonstrates a unique intersection of the colonial structure of museums, and the historical use of education as a colonial tool. The Burke Museum’s Education Department developed approachable decolonizing frameworks for program design through addressing both internal department structures, and external community partnerships. This session offers a case study on designing decolonizing frameworks for museum education, and an opportunity to discuss how the frameworks can be adapted for various institutions and fields.
