With the open fishbowl format, we are hoping to have participation by attendees, where they will share their projects and/or roadblocks and lessons learned. In this way, all attendees and panelists can learn from each other. 
 
Planned outcomes:
1) Practical examples of engaging communities in sharing stewardship while also sharing authority with those outside of the museum.
2) Attendees will learn how to scale and adapt projects to their own institutions. 
3) Share all the steps in a project, to help empower others to be successful in their own projects, including reaching out to communities, funding, lessons learned, etc."""

This facilitated conversation will focus on how museum professionals are relinquishing authority to Indigenous communities to be more inclusive, equitable, and accessible institutions. Panelists will bring different perspectives and experiences, where we share how we are shifting ideas of authority and power to source communities. Attendees are encouraged to share and participate in this open conversation.
