session_objectives = """Attendees will learn all how the three following ingredients help to make an educational and entertaining soup: 1) how two nonprofit organizations–Western Neighborhoods Project and the San Francisco Neighborhood Theatre Foundation–work together to preserve, interpret and share the story of neighborhood theaters; 2) how arts and culture programming supports traditional screenings in theaters; and 3) how two neighborhood residents saved a local theater from permanently closing, or worse, demolition. Private citizens saved the 4 Star Theater in San Francisco’s Richmond District, an accomplished manager took over operations, and nonprofit history groups help them stay relevant. In light of a projected deficit in the city’s budget over the next two years, the combination of all three of these sectors working together is critical to the survival of arts and culture in San Francisco."""
session_engagement = """The audience will arrive to a curated playlist of fun songs as they find their seats, and we’ll hand out popcorn for everyone in attendance so they’re ready for the show. During the session, everyone will have a chance to be part of the conversation following a brief introduction to all our speakers and what we’re here to chat about."""
session_scalability = """Partnerships are possible at every level. Obviously, not everyone can purchase a theater but the throughline of the conversation will be how all panelists, as members of the community, support each other and find creative solutions to what seem like insurmountable problems.

Join us for a moderated conversation with a neighborhood historian and theater preservationist, as well as a veteran theater manager in San Francisco, and new theater owners in which we discuss how neighborhood theaters can and are functioning best as cultural centers that are more approachable than traditional museums or historical societies, and how we're all trying to work together to celebrate and save these cathedrals to neighborhood history.
