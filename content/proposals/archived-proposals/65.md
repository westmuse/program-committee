They will think about the goals for their projects, how they plan to reach those goals, and how they can incorporate new partnerships through those projects. During this brainstorming session, participants will also think back on past projects to reflect on how they can work in different ways to achieve goals by using partnerships.
The second objective will be for the participants to begin compiling a list of partners, even if they are unsure of how they might work together. By first identifying possible partners, they can begin to move forward with thinking of innovative ways to involve those possible partners in their projects.
The third objective will be to work together in their small groups, and with the presenters, to formulate ways to involve these partners in a manner that would benefit both organizations. They will devise plans that will help facilitate conversations around the possible outcomes."""

Unconventional and innovative? Yes, please! The right partnerships can have a huge impact on your organization and community. This workshop will present examples from three museums on how unique partnerships have played a role in successful projects. Even with tight budgets, small staff sizes, and rural locations! In addition, attendees will be allotted time to workshop some ideas through a handout with feedback from the presenters and colleagues.
