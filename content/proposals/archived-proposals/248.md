Come hear from three organizations in various stages of implementing shared leadership models: Five Oaks Museum, San Diego Museum of Natural History, and Nesika Wilamut (Portland area non-profit). They will discuss successes, pitfalls, and new ways of approaching leadership in non-profits. Bring your questions, as there will time at the end of the session for Q&A and group discussion.
