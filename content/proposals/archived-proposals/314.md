It is important for museum professionals to get ahead of this technology and understand the risks that come with using it."""

1.  Participants will get an overview of how AI-generated images are being used in museums and will understand how the technology generates images.
2. Participants will understand the myriad benefits of using the technology, and will understand the risks so they make informed decisions as to whether and how to use the technology.
3. Participants will obtain emerging best practices on the use of AI-generated images"""
session_engagement = """Participants will be engaged by having a live AI-art demonstration done in real-time as part of the presentation to see how the technology works.  The take-away for participants will be that it is an exciting new technology that does things faster and cheaper than a human artist, and it is therefore very tempting to employ as part of visitor experience, outreach, marketing, and even in gallery spaces, but there are several risks to doing so.  Participants will walk away with critical information to make informed decisions on whether and how to use this technology."""

Connecting with stakeholders and enhancing the visitor experience using AI (artificial intelligence) - generated images as compared to hiring an artist is quick, affordable, convenient, and easily accessible, but there is much controversy surrounding the technology, and using it in your museum or on social media comes with risks.  This session explains how AI-generated "art" works, why the technology is so controversial, and delivers emerging best practices for its use in your museum and online.
