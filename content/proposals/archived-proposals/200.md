(2) Participants will learn about universal design - along with other accessibility accommodations - in order to reimagine their programs and physical spaces beyond ADA compliance and towards equitable accessible practices. (3) Participants will  be supported in identifying deficiencies in their own institutions to create actionable steps toward a personalized accessibility plan."""
session_engagement = """We will spend 1.5 hours diving into disabilities (history, language, etc.), accommodations, and scenario planning. During the latter, attendees will share how they’d handle different scenarios with patrons who are disabled, with an opportunity to learn from one another and engage in deep conversation. Attendees will then work in small groups to identify accessibility deficiencies at their museum and begin drafting an accessibility plan with support and guidance from the presenters."""
session_scalability = """Accessibility is relevant no matter the size or scope of the organization. Too often, museums consider only ADA compliance. This session will address different disabilities and accommodations for various disabilities, with the hopes that museums of any size can implement better policies. The accessibility plan attendees will begin during the workshop includes short, intermediate, and long-term goals based on the idea that not all organizations have the resources (staff or funds) to meet the same goals on the same timeline. Personalizing a plan to meet their needs is what we encourage, not only with cultural organizations here in Utah who have completed the training but also through this workshop. Finally, the workshop provides attendees the opportunity to meet staff from a Utah non-profit who can assist in future accessibility work so the learning and experience does not have to end when the workshop does.

Museums need to address disability and work to create exceedingly accessible spaces for people with disabilities. During this workshop, participants will learn how a state agency and non-profit teamed up to create accessibility training for cultural professionals across Utah. Participants will dive into some of the accessibility and accommodations content before working to identify deficiencies in their own spaces. Participants will leave having started an Accessibility Plan for their museum. We recommend 2+ participants/museum.
