Now more than ever, museums must build the capacities needed to continually evolve, operate efficiently, and serve their communities. Presenters from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and TCC Group will discuss findings from their March 2021 Market Analysis and Opportunity Assessment of Museum Capacity Building Programs report. Session participants will explore how museum leaders can overcome the barriers that impede organizational strengthening and invest their limited resources to support real organizational change.
