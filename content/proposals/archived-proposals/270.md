1. Gain an understanding of how genres work and how they can be applied as overall guides to interpretive planning and exhibition design.
2. Learn how to articulate and deploy story elements to realize the story genre concept for a particular exhibition development.
3. Practice applying markers of story and genres in label writing, while also thinking about how these can complement non-verbal content to tell an overall consistent story about the exhibition. 
Throughout the workshop, you will have a chance to discuss your ideas with other participants and give and receive constructive feedback."""

Stories are powerful. They engage visitors on a personal level, fix ideas and details in their memories, and encourage empathy with unfamiliar historical people and events. This hands-on workshop will help you understand and use story elements and genres to discover the most compelling connection between your exhibition content and audience for your next history-based exhibition.
