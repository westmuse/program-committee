session_objectives = """1. Analyze the definition and classification of “archives” in museums and other collecting organizations, as well as examine how museum records are currently utilized and the potential they hold for developing new audiences. Specifically, how are institutional records (such as administrative or exhibition files) and collection records (accession files, catalog, and research) viewed through an archival lens?
2. Think critically about current systems of archives organization, both physically and intellectually, and their effectiveness in relevant, inclusive, and accurate information sharing and retrieval. What are the best approaches for museum staff who have other responsibilities in developing archives?
3. Identify methods for using the archives innovatively in fostering outreach to new interdisciplinary audiences, aligning the museum with social justice goals of shifting authoritative voice to develop more inclusive storytelling."""
session_engagement = """As attendees arrive, project slide deck questions and provide same questions on 3x5” cards for engagement between speaker sections.
Questions might include: 
Are archives being used in your organization? If so, how?
How can you imagine using archives differently?
What does accessibility look like in museum archives?
How are collection records currently being used?
Who engages with your archives?
Do you have an archive accessibility plan?

Need computer projector with laptop hook up."""

other_comments = """Classification standards, nomenclatures, and lexicons are useful tools to describe and organize collections and archives for the purpose of physical and cultural preservation, and efficient, effective information retrieval. These tools require critical consideration and must never be used to define people, objects, or communities. Language matters. We should forever be inspecting classification standards, whose origins can be highly problematic due to the traditionally homogenous groups who originally developed them.

Further, in the framework of making physical records/archives accessible, databases are also useful tools. However, culturally sensitive content warnings, or removal of images of human remains, etc. are important to consider with community partners."""
theme_relationship = """A brave, FORWARD-looking, integrated approach to archive and collection accessibility is key to museum relevance and community voice. In the past, records oversight at museums kept records largely hidden. Activating the archives opens doors for an organization’s accountability, discovery of cultural responsibilities, and enrichment of education and interpretation. The community dialog that archival information informs can challenge institutional history and collecting practices, thereby empowering new perspectives."""

Exciting possibilities await us when we invest in museum archives! Through archives, relevant and engaging connections happen and a more inclusive, approachable space for community results. Learn how nascent collection and institutional archives expand accessibility, reach new audiences, and create unexpected discoveries that empower and shift narratives. This session will explore approaches to improving collections accessibility and holding space for diverse connections through archives.
