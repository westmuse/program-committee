session_objectives = """Attendees will learn about:

1. Finding Common Ground: An ambitious effort by the Balboa Park Cultural Partnership to develop a unified and inclusive “Experience Plan” for the Balboa Park Cultural District. 

2. Identifying and Meaningfully Engaging Community Members: The development and implementation of a Community Advisory Board tasked with advising the Cultural Partnership on (1) the initial RFP, (2) the selection of the experience planning firm, and (3) network mobilization.

3. The Value of Transparency and Active Listening: The process by which community members were engaged as well as the input they provided, including how it informed the final experience plan itself.

About the panel: The diverse panel will have three unique perspectives: (1) an Advisory Board member who can speak to the successes and challenges of being an engaged board member, (2) a consultant who can share the process of identifying the right partners for the RFP and how they quickly built connections in a new community to deliver on their project objectives, (3) a visionary leader who created the framework for the Experience Plan and his vision for implementation beyond the final written document."""

This panel shares the Balboa Park Cultural Partnership’s journey in creating a new community-centered Experience Plan for its Cultural District. Leveraging the input and networks of a highly diverse Community Advisory Board, the plan’s development process prioritized connecting with BIPOC and border communities as well as with young people. The result? A far more welcoming and representative vision for the Cultural District that will serve visitors from San Diego’s tri-national region and beyond.
