Gifts of collections, including family papers, literary archives, artwork, and botanical specimens, can enlighten, inform, and inspire visitors of all ages and backgrounds. Join us for a presentation and lively discussion on cultivating, accepting, and stewarding gifts of collections (also known as gifts in kind or tangible personal property) with two curators and a fundraiser. Topics include building and activating diverse collections, managing donor relationships, gift acceptance policies, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and promoting community engagement. Share your own experiences and perspectives on the challenges and opportunities of stewarding gifts of objects/collections during the Q&A.
