- Think critically about real challenges that occur when: balancing objects’ physical exposure with safety of collections; inviting community to share stories and information using public and/or digital platforms; and addressing transparent histories behind collections responsibly with integrity and sensitivity 
- Identify methods for using collections innovatively by fostering outreach to new interdisciplinary audiences, aligning the museum with social justice goals of shifting authoritative voice on collections from scholarly research to more inclusive storytelling by communities"""
session_engagement = """Active break-out group discussion, active whole-group discussion, independent hands-on activity, whole-group reflection. 
 
Resources needed: 
- Paper, pencils, and clipboards for notes and outlining
- Online submissions Google form (attendees can use their phones or one of the Facilitators/Presenters can facilitate online collections portal browsing and submitting entries using laptops)
- A/V setup: Monitor or projector with screen and sound capability
- Compatibility adapters for laptops, and laptops (Facilitator and Presenters provide their own)"""
session_scalability = """Performing outreach to communities using museum collections requires connection, communication, and collaboration across multiple areas of the museum. Collections outreach means something different to every organization depending on their primary audience, the types of collections they manage, and their mission and vision. Museums perform outreach using collections in exhibitions, but are increasingly searching for ways to bring collections to the public safely and responsibly: mobile collections vans visiting schools, bringing additional objects to the gallery floor without plex, behind-the-scenes facilities tours, online collections portals, public archives finding aids, utilizing social media and other digital platforms to explore objects in new ways, and more. By sharing experiences, collections professionals can learn new ways of performing collections outreach from each other without reinventing the wheel.

A notoriously small percentage of museum collections actually make it to the gallery floor. Collections staff regularly uncover hidden stories behind objects through their everyday hands-on interactions with collections and their records. While educators and interpreters approach collections based on a learning plan or exhibition narrative, collections managers and registrars encounter objects’ stories systematically through inventory, cataloging, and research. How do we collaborate with other teams to share objects’ stories from our behind-the-scenes work?
