What are best practices for advancing equitable practices in museums? This interactive session introduces new tools and resources focused on fostering dialogue within museum teams about DEAI (diversity, equity, access and inclusion) practices and action.  Currently in development by CCLI (Cultural Competence Learning Institute) and featuring data from a recent museum-wide study, the tools include _Actionable Insights_ for museums to leverage institutional strengths and take action toward inclusive practice for their institutions.
