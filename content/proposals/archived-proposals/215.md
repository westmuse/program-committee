World Forestry Center and Upswell invite conference attendees to participate in a workshop focused on how an exhibition prototype can serve as a platform for new approaches to audience engagement and inform the transformation of museums into sites for social change.

The workshop focuses on the World Forestry Center’s vision for the future and renovation of their museum in Portland’s Washington Park, and will provide a framework that participants can apply to their own projects.
