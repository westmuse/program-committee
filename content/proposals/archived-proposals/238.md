**Many museum workers have encountered war trophies or looted objects in their collections, but there is no field-wide consensus on how to address them. War booty can take many forms. Does all booty occupy the same ethical territory, or are there “good” and “bad” kinds? Is my institution the right place to interpret these items? These are questions we will address from multiple angles, with a panel of museum professionals from a variety of backgrounds.**
