They will learn new approaches and receive new tools for program planning and consider how to customize them.
 
They will hear four different ways to approach program planning, from institutions of varying size and scope – and recognize a parallel in at least one example.
 
They will engage in conversation about program planning through breakout sessions, and explore how others are doing their work.
 
And, they will expand their networks through the breakout sessions."""

**In this session, learn how four different museums build and deliver their yearly programs. Join us for stories and tips from four different organizations, ranging from small to large, and learn the different ways we create and manage our programs. Hear ideas on building strategy, identifying audiences, balancing the offerings, assessment, and more. We’ll share our experiences, favorite tools, processes, and plenty of real talk.**
