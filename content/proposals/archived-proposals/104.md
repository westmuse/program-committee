Social platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Reddit present evolving opportunities for museum professionals to share resources, ask questions, recognize trends, and amplify experiences for the benefit of the sector. This session will include strategies for finding peers to follow, hashtags to use, and groups that serve as gathering spaces for different areas of museum work. Participants will enhance their understanding of how to use social networking during and after the WMA Meeting.
