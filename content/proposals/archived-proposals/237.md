Maxville is a former timber town in remote northeast Oregon, which in its heyday, from 1924 to 1933, was the largest city in Wallowa County. Maxville was a timber town like so many others in the Pacific Northwest, except Maxville was home to African American and white loggers who worked side-by-side felling timber and lived in a segregated community with their families during a period when black exclusionary and sundown laws existed in Oregon. Learn how Maxville Heritage Interpretive Center is bringing the ghost town of Maxville back to life to tell its fascinating history by purchasing 240 acres of the forestland that contains the original town site.
