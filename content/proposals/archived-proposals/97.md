Having an accessibly website is important to letting this audience know what is available for them. Participants will see examples of website screen shots that clearly convey the Museum’s access opportunities and front lobby signs when they are in the door.
Lastly, take away a basic to do list to check whether your institution is accessible and develop guidelines for increasing access."""

This case study presentation tracks a board-driven initiative to increase access for all visitors through programming, signs, and materials developed to engage our audience. Museum Educators from the Charles M. Schulz Museum worked with local school districts, businesses, trained experts, and product manufacturers to increase the Museum’s commitment to inclusion of audiences with unique needs. Learn about the Museum’s accessibility initiatives and what steps you can take to increase access in your Museum.
