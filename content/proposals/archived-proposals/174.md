This session examines three different partnerships between museums and medical institutions. Each offers a different approach on how a museum's collection can provide new ways for training medical professionals and addressing patient care and wellness. Panelists representing work from the  Seattle Art Museum, Crocker Art Museum, and The Hammer Museum will discuss how a museum's collection, open ended inquiry, close looking, and art-making can engage healthcare professionals and patients, while panelists from Virginia Mason Hospital, UC Davis School of Medicine, and UCLA School of Medicine will dive into current research around this budding field, and ways for museums to further engage medical schools, hospitals, and patients.
