Words matter: Hear from different types of institutions and museum professionals at various levels about ways we should rethink the words we use in our work. Speakers will talk about language in promoting equity museum hiring and the visitor experience, from the logistics of how institutions can foster change to a checklist for implementing updates. Participants will have time to speak directly to presenters and leave with tools they can use in their own institutions.
