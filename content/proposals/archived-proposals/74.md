That said, I will be using my work as an example in the workshop and hope that participants will see me as a resource afterwards. If the review committee has any questions or suggestions about how the workshop can provide the most benefit to participants or potential co-presenters, I’d love your input.

Why does your museum matter? How are you creating positive change in your community? This hands-on, half-day workshop will introduce museum professionals to a variety of tools that they can use to answer these questions for themselves, stakeholders, community members, and funders. Participants will learn how to use visual Theories of Change, Theories of Action, and Logic Models to capture “why” and “how” they are making a difference.
