Do you need to set a value for an outgoing loan, determine a loss in case of damage or theft, and confirm the purchase price for a new acquisition? Do you need to document a proposed deaccession or a value to support an application for public funding or grant? Then you need to attend this session. Join your colleagues in learning what is an appraisal, how to read an appraisal and how to choose a certified appraiser. In addition, we will review related legal items that might affect your institution and panelists will review museum policies that will be useful to your overall collections management.
