Currently, Gravity Goldberg (Director of Public Programs and Visitor Experience, The Contemporary Jewish Museum) has confirmed her interest and availability to be a panelist. Phillip Thompson (Executive Director, Idaho Black History Museum) has expressed interest. I have a few other irons in the fire as well. I am trying to find 3 panelists that will cover a few different perspectives on this topic as well as being representative of different types of museums at various scales. One area I am lacking panelists is around the issue of creating welcome beyond a group of core enthusiasts. (For our museum that might mean making "non-car-people" feel a sense of welcome and belonging at our motorsports museum.) I am open to suggestions and ideas for additional panelists that have had successes at their museum that they can share.

Some museums naturally serve a very focused demographic in their region. Join representatives from 3 “niche” museums to learn about $how they strive to stay true to their mission and core audience while making sure that all in their region feel a sense of welcome and belonging. This session will identify challenges and strategies to creating a welcoming environment and sense of belonging when your museum has a tight mission that serves a specific audience.
