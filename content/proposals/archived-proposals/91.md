• How a museum blog can play a critical role in your institution’s overall content marketing strategy
• How a blog can help institutions reach new audiences and spark conversations that are not possible on other channels.

Participants will also be encouraged to ask questions about marketing, content strategy, editorial, logistical, or technical aspects of creating and running a museum blog."""
