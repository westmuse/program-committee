2) Participants will learn best practices for meeting community needs in the wake of devastating personal loss and disaster and will benefit from lessons learned about responses that were not beneficial and how best intentions are not always best practices. 
3) Participants will learn about and receive hand-outs listing local and national organizations that respond to natural disasters and are available for partnerships, recommended natural disaster preparedness plans and kits, and direct contact information for museum staff willing to share their customized natural disaster plans and responses."""
session_engagement = """After sharing how four museums lived through different wildfires at different times and met visitor needs in mission-driven, meaningful, relevant, and deeply personal ways, we will invite questions and discussion from participants, so each participant will be able to create a site-specific blueprint for how to respond if the need arises in their own community. Participants will see images, details of specific programs, and take away hand-outs with information and resources."""
session_scalability = """  The museums presenting range from very small to mid-sized, include art and history collections, and responded to different fires of differing magnitudes and the Covid pandemic in different parts of Northern California. They will demonstrate how any museum of any size can respond to community needs in ways that meet their mission, preserve their collection, and respect staff losses and experiences as well as those of members, volunteers, and the community.
Museums of Lake County has only one full-time employee and serves a population of around 64,000 through three history-focused sites and will share their ongoing response to the 2015 Valley Fire that destroyed almost 2,000 structures and the Mendocino Complex Fire of 2018. The Charles M. Schulz Museum, a mid-sized single-artist museum, and Museum of Sonoma County, a mid-size Smithsonian Affiliate art and history museum that serves Sonoma County (with a population of about 480,000) and led community-wide responses to multiple North Bay Wildfires as well as creating robust virtual program content during the pandemic.
California Indian Museum and Cultural Center has ten staff members and serves a local population of twenty-four tribes throughout Sonoma, Mendocino, and Lake counties. This region includes nearly 8,000 tribal community members, in addition to the local Santa Rosa population of 175,000.
