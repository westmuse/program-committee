We plan to include a brief writing activity where we ask the audience to write down their immediate associations with the word “veteran.” We will fold these responses into our presentation and revisit them later on during the Knowledge Café portion. The audience will have time to brainstorm ways to engage veterans at their museums and share these with the group."""

The share of Americans who are veterans has declined and many people do not personally know anyone who has served. One-dimensional media representations that portray veterans either as heroes or as sufferers of PTSD or homelessness only intensify the military-civilian divide. How can museums provide opportunities for military veterans to express themselves authentically? A museum educator, a film professor, and a veteran share their experiences leading a unique filmmaking program designed for veterans.
