We’ll show how engaging community partners in the process effectively shifts the end-goal of programming to be more aware and inclusive."""

**In an attempt to be more inclusive, The Natural History Museum of Utah is collaborating with community groups on a continuing suite of workshops called “STEM Rooted in Culture.” **
** **
**Western cultures are overrepresented in STEM and diversifying the voices that share science can make space for the many cultures that do science but are ignored by the limitations of our definition of “modern” science. This presentation will share our process and practices.**
