In this session, we delve into the pivotal role of establishing multiple access points within museums across various departments, including education, exhibitions, and marketing, to foster inclusivity and engage diverse communities. By embracing linguistic diversity, we aim to create welcoming environments that resonate with a broad spectrum of visitors. Community engagement lies at the heart of our approach, intertwined with cutting-edge principles of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI).
