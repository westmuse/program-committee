The informal format of multiple discussion and resource stations, where participants can move from one topic to another, gathering resource materials and completing hands-on activities, will encourage interaction between and among the professional archivists and attendees.

In addition to the materials provided at the workshop, participants will be encouraged to join the Museum Archives Network online community initiated by the Museum Association of Arizona to broaden their resource-base and continue their connection with others working with museum archival materials"""

While most museums hold important archival materials, those responsible for these collections, especially in small and mid-sized museums, may not have access to “museum-friendly” training for their organization, care and access.   This workshop, led by professional archivists who have experience working with museums, will provide introductions to key areas of archival practice as they pertain to museum collections, through a series of brief presentations, informal Q-and-A, hands-on activities, and resource materials.
