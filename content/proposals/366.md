Talkback exhibits prompt visitors to respond on Post-it Notes, notebooks, or digital platforms, bringing their perspectives and voices into exhibitions. Such exhibits have become commonplace in museums, but few are treating the responses as data sources and mining them for insights into visitor engagement, meaning-making, and dialogue. In this session, presenters will discuss case studies and provide frameworks for analyzing different types of talkback data. Attendees will share their talkback data and develop analysis plans.
