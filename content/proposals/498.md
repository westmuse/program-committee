2. Build digital capacity with intention: Discover how even small teams can implement sustainable, user-friendly collection systems that grow with their needs.
3. Foster collaboration through technology: Discover how cloud-based platforms like Artwork Archive support cross-departmental workflows and public-facing initiatives.

Attendees will leave with a set of guiding questions and starter steps to begin or refine their institution’s digital access strategies."""

Attendees do not need to use Artwork Archive as their CMS solution. Best practices for bringing collections and exhibitions online will be helpful for museums that have a public-facing portal as part of their CMS—and if they don’t, this presentation shows how feasible bringing collections online can be, offering data and talking points to help make the case to leadership.
