In addition, for Sessio Format - We will explore ways to break the wall between presenters and participants in the Standard Panel format—the “Fishbowl” model might work well after an initial visual presentation / prompts on the subject matter. This first series of prompts could adopt a “PechaKucha” style format, with multiple presenters highlighting their own perspective before opening up the discussion."""
