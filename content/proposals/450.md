session_objectives = """Science narratives are woven into many types of museums, not just science centers, yet they often reflect Western-dominated perspectives that present scientific knowledge as singular and absolute. This session will guide participants in recognizing how these narratives shape exhibits, programming, and visitor engagement across disciplines. By critically examining dominant science communication frameworks, attendees will explore ways to integrate Indigenous knowledge and community-driven perspectives, fostering a more inclusive approach to knowledge-sharing in museums of all kinds.
Through case studies and discussion, participants will gain strategies for co-creating content with Indigenous and historically marginalized communities, ensuring that exhibits and programs reflect diverse ways of knowing. This collaborative approach emphasizes shared authority and authenticity, allowing museums to build stronger relationships with the communities they serve while challenging exclusionary storytelling practices.
By the end of the session, participants will leave with actionable steps to implement these changes in their own institutions. Whether through exhibit design, educational programming, or institutional policies, they will be equipped to reshape how science is communicated, ensuring that multiple knowledge systems are valued and represented. This shift will help museums across disciplines foster more meaningful engagement with their audiences, making interpretive content more inclusive, accurate, and reflective of the diverse worldviews that shape our understanding of the natural and human-made world."""
session_engagement = """This fishbowl session actively engages participants by allowing them to join and exit the discussion, ensuring diverse voices contribute to rethinking science narratives in museums. Facilitators will guide dialogue while case studies spark reflection on integrating Indigenous and community-driven knowledge. No formal presentation—just open, evolving conversation. Chairs will be arranged in a fishbowl format to encourage fluid participation, fostering an interactive, peer-driven exchange of ideas and strategies."""
session_scalability = """The outcomes of this session are adaptable to museums of all types and sizes, from small community institutions to large organizations. Interpretive science narratives shape exhibits in history, art, and cultural museums making inclusive storytelling essential across disciplines. Strategies for integrating Indigenous and community-driven knowledge can be scaled to fit different budgets, staffing structures, and institutional missions. Whether through exhibit design, programming, or policy shifts, participants will gain practical tools to apply these concepts in ways that align with their organization’s capacity while fostering more inclusive and representative science communication and interpretation.

Museums have traditionally communicated science through a Western-centric lens, often presenting it as singular and absolute. This session invites participants into a facilitated fishbowl discussion to explore how museums can challenge dominant science narratives by integrating Indigenous knowledge and diverse perspectives. Through case studies and dialogue, attendees will examine strategies for co-creating content with historically marginalized communities, ensuring that museum exhibits and programming reflect multiple ways of knowing and more inclusive storytelling.
