Join colleagues of all levels from institutions of all sizes to collaboratively BALANCE diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion initiatives with the mission, vision, and strategic plan of the institution. Included in this discussion are free to fee based suggestions spanning marketing/branding, interpersonal interactions, interactions with the public, artifact acquisition selection, text writing, program planning and more. The basics all boil down to the same concepts that are universally applicable.
