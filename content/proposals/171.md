session_objectives = """Institutional Knowledge
The session will promote the importance of maintaining institutional knowledge. In addition, several real world techniques will be examined that the audience can execute the day after the conference.
Staffing
Experienced staff with high morale means fewer mistakes are made, the development and installation is quicker, and the end result is highly engaging for the visitor. The audience will walk away with actionable ideas for onboarding new staff as well as retaining experienced staff. Maintaining high morale is a central part of increasing the capacity of staff, fun and quirky ways of raising morale will be discussed.
Innovation
The audience will learn the prerequisites to innovation and learn to recognize opportunities to help it flourish. Without the building blocks of previous work history (the institutional knowledge) coupled with experienced and efficient staff, innovation can stall. Additionally the audience will come away with methods of fostering and encouraging innovation in a time and budget friendly way."""

That said, I am very open to help in finding our third voice. Preferably female, of color, and not in art or science. Thanks in advance there.
I'm of course willing to merge if it makes for a better WMA 2022.

Expertise in exhibit design, fabrication, and installation is often tied to the talents of individual staff and outside partners; their techniques rarely turn into institutional knowledge. How can we maintain staff and preserve standards and innovations so we can build upon them? 
Join panelists for a roundtable discussion of installation case studies, exploring how we can go from technique to training within a sustainable culture of innovation and productivity.
