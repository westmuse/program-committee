Explore how teachers can use objects in their classroom to extend the museum-to-school learning experience. This session will leverage results from in-depth research with 11 teachers who are experienced with object-based learning. Hear from educator voices representing early learning (preK-K), primary grades (K-2nd) intermediary grades (3rd-5th) and middle school science/social science specialists.  The insights from these educators will voices will shape an interactive discussion with session participants to discuss how both museum educators and classroom teachers can use object-based learning effectively. Participants will be encouraged to shape and improve their own practices for teaching and learning with artifacts, specimens, and objects, as well as consider how this research can inform teacher professional development or other museum-school partnerships. This session is applicable to both museum educators or classroom teachers. Particularly helpful for museums with “museum kit” lending programs, those interested in starting or expanding off-site school partnership programs, or building professional development for teachers. Also applicable to museum educators seeking to engage with more object-based learning during on-site museum programming.
