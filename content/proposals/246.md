Traditional museum conservation fails to address some of the challenges and opportunities inherent in our institutions' outdoor, macro, and  functional artifacts. Whether a lightship, a submarine, a submersible, or your artifact, they sometimes withstand non-standard museum display environments and practices to keep them relevant. Join us for a discussion about preserving historical and educational significance through atypical preservation projects.
