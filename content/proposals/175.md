session_objectives = """With a new executive director at the helm in 2020, WNP dramatically expanded the scope of its vision while staying on mission by including local artists and taking on controversial subjects (sometimes to the detriment of her emotional well-being). This session will highlight initiatives that increased earned revenue and visibility by doing the unthinkable; created dynamic programming that speaks to audiences outside our traditional demographic, which is aging beyond our reach; and provided critical context to heated debates around the purpose of public history and the use of public space. 
We accomplished the first by partnering with a fine art conservator and contemporary art gallery to raise over $150,000 in less than three weeks, allowing us to save historic art and artifacts from auction and then, with support from the National Park Service, open a temporary museum in the former Cliff House Restaurant, which closed in December 2020. The second is illustrated through a collaborative program with the Fort Point Beer Company and a graphic zine created by artist Thorsten Sideboard that engages young learners with illustrated activities centered on history. And, to explain the third, we’ll highlight a virtual program titled “Murals, Monuments, and Memorials” that brought a panel of artists together to discuss how we can rethink public art. 

In the (hopefully) post-pandemic era, cultural nonprofits can no longer afford to be siloed within their own genre if they want to be relevant and we hope this session will show you how."""

Learn how Western Neighborhoods Project (WNP), a one-employee community history nonprofit in San Francisco, California, has expanded its relevance and reach by incorporating the arts into its history practice and providing historic context to difficult conversations, like the toppling of controversial monuments. We’ll discuss how this cuts across the board, from fundraising campaigns to programming and everything in between. There’s something for everyone at this session.
