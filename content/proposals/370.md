    a. Co-Creation
    b. Attendees will:
        i. Learn how to respectfully engage with Indigenous communities and build relationships with cultural practitioners to learn new, more equitable and cultural forms of interpretation within living museums (i.e: framing the space, the creation of tours, activities, and educational materials.)

1. Staged Authenticity vs. Indigenous Authenticity
    a. Attendees will:
        i. Gain insights on how to embrace traditional, spiritual, and religious practices of Indigenous communities within a modern, professional (or institutional setting) context
        ii. Understand the difference between staged authenticity and legitimate, Indigenous authenticity that creates new, equitable framing for Indigenous museums, programming, and collections

1. Identify and design Indigenous, culture-specific “Harm Reduction” practices 
    a. Radical Honesty - Facilitating uncomfortable “safe spaces” such as exploring uncomfortable cultural histories/realities and understanding settler positionalities when visiting an Indigenous place 
    b. Creating informative, yet sometimes uncomfortable, educational programs/pamphlets to inform visitors"""

The International Indigenous Librarians’ Forum (IILF) convened for the first time in Hawaiʻi in November 2023. IILF opened at Waimea Valley on O’ahu where an archaeological kauhale (house site) was transformed into a living museum for Forum Delegates to explore under the direction of Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners. This talk investigates the creation of a cross-cultural, professional gathering using indigenous protocols and authentic interpretation within a context of colonial tourism and settler occupation in Hawaiʻi.
