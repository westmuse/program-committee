Exhibition content can be difficult, and it is vitally important for museums to anticipate how to help visitors not only engage with challenging content but also to provide support after they have viewed an exhibition. The panelists in this session will share their experiences presenting exhibitions at their institutions that contained difficult content, strategies for supporting visitors, and suggestions for museums who are looking to best serve their audiences.
