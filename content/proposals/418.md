Since 2007, the Tucson Museum of Art has partners with the Alzheimer’s Association Desert Southwest Chapter to provide a program for people with dementia and their caregiver. In this session, learn about how the program is designed, how staff and volunteers are trained, and what successes and failure the program has had. Hear from both the museum as well as the Alzheimer Association to understand the benefit of a program like this.
