2. Best practices for outdoor education and science communication. Attendees will learn about current outdoor education best practices, which includes rooting in place, starting small, and making the outdoors accessible, and which can be adapted at any scale or price point. They will also learn about current best practices to communicate science and engage audiences. 
3. Art activity focused on plant pollinator interactions. To reinforce the nature lessons learned, the attendees will create a laminated bookmark depicting plant-pollinator interactions."""

We will also serve a sampling of native foods after the hike."""

During the hike, we will also demonstrate ways to adapt to fit the various needs of attendees (such as those with mobility or sensory issues).

To better appreciate the natural landscape of Tucson, Arizona, and to demonstrate best practices in outdoor education, we will be hosting an educational ethnobotanical nature hike followed by a plant-pollinator art activity. This activity will highlight the combined knowledges of the San Diego Natural History Museum, the Barona Cultural Center & Museum, and the New Children’s Museum. This activity is for those who teach children and adults about nature or are interested in learning more themselves.
