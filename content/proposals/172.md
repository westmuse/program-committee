Participants will do a warm-up activity and hear an overview of the session’s agenda and learning objectives. Participants will share current challenges in engaging teams with data, and strategies they have used to date. The presenters will offer a framework for a three-step method to make meaning of data (Scan, Diagnose, Prioritize). Participants will then learn an overview of how the participatory data analysis activities in the _Dabbling in the Data_ guide that can be used at each of the three steps. 
**Guided Practice (2 hours)**
Using sample data from a museum education program, session participants will follow the three-step method to analyze data (Scan, Diagnose, Prioritize). At each step participants will: 1) Learn participatory data-analysis activities that can be used for the step; 2) Practice one of the activities in-depth; and 3) Reflect on how their organization’s learning goals could be supported by one of these activities. 
Scan: Participants will start by getting a 10,000-foot view of their data landscape. These activities will help participants make better informed decisions about which aspects of their program deserve a deeper dive. 
Practice Activity: In Mind the Gap, participants will explore differences between two sets of sample data, mapping the data sets, creating dot plots to visualize differences between data sets and discussing what they see. This exercise allows users to explore systematic relationships between data sets, such as differences in visitor feedback among different exhibits. 
Diagnose: Next participants will figure out what’s driving the patterns they picked in the Scan phase. These activities will help participants get to the underlying reasons. 
Practice Activity: In Iceberg Analysis, participants will identify the factors that contribute to an observable phenomenon, such as increases in museum visitorship. Using the iceberg as an analogy, this exercise helps teams to identify what's "beneath the surface" of something they observe in their museum.
Prioritize: Finally, participants will use what they learned from the Diagnose phase to identify the highest value opportunities to make a lasting change. 
Practice Activity: In Magic Quadrant, participants will engage in a structured conversation activity to support group decision-making. Participants will generate potential steps and then categorize each step by the level of effort and impact. By categorizing potential solutions to reach a goal, participants will gain an understanding of the impact and related level of effort of each possible step.
Break (20 minutes) 
**Connecting to Organizational Values (30 minutes)**
Session participants will explore the ways in which participatory data interpretation can support their organization’s values, such as a great visitor experience, attracting and engaging a variety of audiences, and supporting the professional development of staff members. Participants will practice their “pitch” for more participatory approaches to data interpretation based on the connections they find.
**Closing and Reflection (30 minutes)**
Participants will reflect on how the activities can support their own work. Participants will use our Take-It-Back planner to identify a meaning-making opportunity in their organization and to develop an implementation plan.

Data can help museums and cultural institutions target their services and tell their story.  However, the prospect of collecting and analyzing data can be intimidating and frustrating, especially for those with limited training in program evaluation. 

In this session, participants will learn interactive, participatory activities to engage teams with their data, yielding actionable insights and powerful stories. Participants will have the opportunity to practice activities and learn how to link the methods to specific learning needs in their organizations.
