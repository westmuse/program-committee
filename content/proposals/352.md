session_objectives = """Participants will learn from the experience of two local, established institutions how to get their teams to think about collaboration creatively. Presenters will share insights on how to garner buy-in from organizational leadership, colleagues and donors in creating non-traditional, long-term partnerships successfully. Attendees will come away with an understanding of how to create opportunities that benefit all involved equitably and avoid scarcity mindset hurdles and "it will never work" naysayers.

 Creative collaboration can stretch your team, blow up your attendance, expand your audience and build your brand.  Hear from two organizations who turned a pilot program into a permanent merger and how this model could work for you. Learn how to start, what questions to ask, the necessary elements for success and what red flags to watch for.  
 
 Takeaways will include considerations for joint fundraising efforts, marketing opportunities, programming and event potential, and the critical element of staff and board buy-in.  Learn how collaboration can benefit your organization, your community, and your bottom line without a scarcity mindset."""
session_engagement = """Presenters will share the timeline, images and data points from a successful collaboration of two organizations in a long-term partnership. Examples of challenges faced as shared opportunities for learning will include organization-wide considerations, including communications planning, board engagement, budgeting, facilities responsibilities and the all-important visitor experience. 
Presenters will engage audience participants with Q+A opportunities based on how this partnership structure can be scaffolded, scaled, piloted and implemented universally."""
session_scalability = """The presentation will include scalability opportunities for emerging museums to consider non-traditional settings for pop-up pilots as well as established mid-size and larger organizations to consider longer-term partnerships that build community engagement in novel and inclusive ways.

In 2023, the Children’s Museum Tucson moved their satellite location to Tohono Chul Park. Through this unique and groundbreaking collaboration, this botanical garden has become a go-to destination for families and kids, a demographic that previously made up less than 20% of park attendance.
Directors from these two organizations will share the success of this venture and lessons learned for thinking creatively about collaboration to find innovative ways to team up with other unlikely partners.
