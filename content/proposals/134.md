session_engagement = """After sharing how three museums lived through different wildfires at different times and met visitor needs in mission-driven, meaningful, relevant, and deeply personal ways, we will invite questions and discussion from participants, so each participant will be able to create a site-specific blueprint for how to respond if the need arises in their own community. Participants will see images, details of specific programs, and take away hand-outs with information and resources."""
session_scalability = """The museums presenting range from very small to mid-sized, include art and history collections, and responded to different fires of differing magnitudes in different parts of Northern California over the last five years. They will demonstrate how any museum of any size can respond to community needs in ways that meet their mission, preserve their collection, and respect staff losses and experiences as well as those of members, volunteers, and the community. Museums of Lake County has only one full-time employee and serves a population of around 64,000 through three history-focused sites and will share their ongoing response to the 2015 Valley Fire that destroyed almost 2,000 structures and the Mendocino Complex Fire of 2018. The Charles M. Schulz Museum, a mid-sized single-artist museum, and Museum of Sonoma County, a small art and history museum with two sites, both serve Santa Rosa, with a population of about 175,000, and are still responding to the 2017 North Bay Wildfires that destroyed over 8,000 structures and the 2019 Kincade fires.

As natural disasters become prevalent, hear how three museums responded to devastating wildfires and learn innovative ways to help your own community heal. Each museum will share how they addressed the fires in thoughtful and meaningful ways while staying true to their missions and protecting their collections. Through partnerships, interactive social media platforms, reflective exhibitions, collecting oral histories, and developing programs and events, each museum became a place of gathering, engagement, connection, reflection, and support.
