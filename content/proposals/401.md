Arizona State Museum's They Don't Love You Like I Love You: Indigenous Perspectives on Sovereignty consists of five exhibits curated by members of Native Nations in Arizona. Look at their process for developing exhibits highlighting contemporary voices, arts and creative interpretation of social justice solutions - including tribal sovereignty, water rights, and historic injustices influencing their lives today. Discussion addresses how ASM initiated the process and stepped aside to allow curators' vision and voices to come to life.
