2.           Use of indigenous language throughout the garden and how that language is presented in an easily reproducible way. How is the language read? How is the language pronounced? What low-tech no-tech strategies can be used?
3.           How TEK is vital to addressing resource concerns in a world under climate crisis. The Mojave Desert and Las Vegas are in a period of prolonged aridification. What lessons can be learned from the people who have lived with the land here for time immemorial?"""
