1. Describe how your museum, regardless of discipline, can collaborate with healthcare professionals and artists, to create robust and meaningful museum-based wellness programs.
2. Gain insight into how to use your own museum’s unique collection for developing programs for health and wellbeing
3. Experience your own increased sense of decompression
4. Describe how to foster museum staff and visitor wellbeing and belonging.
5. Describe how to measure effectiveness of a workshop experience using our framework
 
Learning Outcomes:

The main potential learning outcomes are that participants in this workshop will go back to their own organizations with concrete skills and vision for implementing a similar wellbeing program that meets the needs of their own unique environments–both internal (staff, faculty) and external (visitors, community engagement). Experiencing one of our workshops and having a “behind the scenes” look at what goes into creating and implementing our unique framework, will give participants confidence and skills to design their own. They will also have a tool to measure effectiveness of the activity."""
session_engagement = """The audience first engages in a facilitated close-looking and close reading activity using the framework we developed, and illustrate in our upcoming book Harnessing the Power of Objects. Next, participants engage in a hands-on creative activity led by local artist Elmer Yazzie. All art supplies provided. We end with facilitated small group discussions on how to consider object-based experiences at one's own institution. Resources needed: tables, chairs, digital projector."""
session_scalability = """One of the unique aspects of our workshop is that it is _highly_ scalable and adaptable to organizations of all different types and sizes. In this workshop, we utilize visual art and poems as our featured objects, however, we emphasize that any object can be used as the centerpiece of a workshop. For example, a museum of natural history may choose to feature a fossil, while a science museum may choose an analog telephone, and a botanic garden may choose a native plant, all to align with a workshop theme of _Growth_.

The presenters have led these workshops in an art museum and medical school classroom, gallery spaces, online workshops, hospital hallways, and a local community pub. In this workshop we encourage participants to imagine concrete ways in which they can utilize our framework in their own unique settings.

In this interactive, half-day workshop, participants will learn, practice, and brainstorm how to harness the power of objects in their own collections to promote wellbeing and belonging. Presenters will first share background on our partnership of a museum and a medical center, utilizing Visual Thinking Strategies and Narrative Medicine practice. Participants will then engage in a workshop experience, followed by a facilitated discussion of how to imagine similar programming in your own museum settings.
