session_objectives = """This session examines strategies for cultivating environments where teams are encouraged to overcome interpretation and design challenges faced when producing multimedia projects.  Through case study presentations, ensuing panelist discussion, and audience participation, panelists dive into methodologies inspired by the following topics: saving space for risk-taking; shaping a collective idea; strategically balancing experimentation with stakeholder review; and building team trust and camaraderie. By exploring the creative process through different lenses, attendees will understand how they can apply these philosophies within their own teams.  In addition to theoretical applications, the case studies also provide project tools and specific examples that led to successful or productive outcomes. These takeaways include actual processes, workflows, and ideas for team member inclusion. Attendees will feel welcome to take and adapt these approaches.       By candidly engaging in the nuances of creative collaboration, and discovering that it presents similar stressors and challenges across a diversity of disciplines and institutions, attendees will leave the session feeling a part of a community where they find inspiration and support."""
session_engagement = """Presenters will share their experiences in an open and honest way. Demonstrating the core notion that “a good idea can come from anywhere”, attendees will feel empowered to contribute by asking questions and digging deeper into points that resonate with them. The presence of additional case study team members who can chime into the discussion will further blur the boundary between the panel and the audience enabling a more inclusive and lively group conversation."""

Co-creation is a powerful approach for museums producing dynamic work, but it can be complicated! While creative projects benefit from including a diverse group of perspectives and skill sets, how can we encourage each team member’s contributions within frameworks that keep everyone moving forward, together? Join team representatives as they present three different multimedia project case studies to launch a deeper exploration of various philosophies, methodologies, and tools employed in collective problem-solving.
