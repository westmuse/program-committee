How can museums support individual and community wellness, belonging, and resilience? Hear a case study from the Palo Alto Art Center about _Creative Attention,_ an initiative that included an exhibition, artist residencies, an art therapy residency, public programs, and wellness programs. As part of the session, participate in a virtual meditation with our wellness program provider and use one the prompts created by our art therapist in an artmaking session.
