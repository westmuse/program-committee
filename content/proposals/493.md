All museums in the United States sit on Native land. The field has struggled and in many cases failed to provided support to Native communities. The panel will provide insight on consultation and collaboration which not only meets federal mandates but encourages meaningful partnership development with Tribal nations with exhibition, interpretation, and collection care with Tribal cultural sensitivity as the foundation.
