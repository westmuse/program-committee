  Grab a s’more and take a seat around the (artificial) campfire as we swap even more unimaginable but true tales of museum craft, such as:
||Ghoulish stories of guest services (The Mysterious handprint…)
||Hair raising tales of HR (They did what?)
||Truly terrifying tours ( I turned around and they were gone!)
|| Eerie archival practices (What’s in the box?)
\*Learn from those who have lived to tell these tales?..and share your own if you dare!
