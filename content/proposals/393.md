session_objectives = """The panel will seek to achieve the following:
- Provide definitions of “corporate social responsibility” and why companies engage with the community
- Tips for application success with the most standard funding relationships (grants, event sponsorships)
- Identify multiple types of corporate/museum partnership including and beyond monetary transactions (in-kind giving, volunteer opportunities, co-creative programming) and insights for developing those partnerships"""
session_engagement = """There will be a QR code available throughout the presentation to encourage participants to submit questions as part of the panel structure instead of waiting until the end. It will hopefully boost participation from those who might be more introverted and would prefer not to speak up vocally. There will also be polling and quizzes (for prizes!) also to be completed virtually via QR code."""
session_scalability = """The panelists will include museum development professionals at various career stages: director of institutional giving, development coordinator, community relations manager, and director of philanthropy. Their experiences will cover big dollar partnerships to regular sponsorship award cycles, which should appeal to both larger institutions and be accessible to smaller ones with few or no dedicated development staff. NOTE: We are still looking for a fourth panelist - a museum development professional outside of Arizona.
