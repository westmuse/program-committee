session_objectives = """The objective of this session is for the audience to receive a case study example showing the successful organization of a project that utilized our internal exhibit design process. The learning objective would be inspiration to implement the template and understand how to modify it for their organization. This method can be applied to organizations and museums big and small as well as internally and externally. We define each step of the process clearly and then show how it can be tailored to suit that project’s specific needs. A presentation will be used to show how every project starts with a pre-design brief that defines the project and key stakeholders. The more this template has been used the clearer our colleagues understand the process, and how expectations are defined. The process also defines justice, equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility (JEDIA) principals throughout each step in order to capture data and identify needs early. The audience will be engaged to ask questions about how they can use this tool in their organization. Panel members will consist of representatives from EBRPD and APA that started with two different processes but were able to use this template to improve communications, project organization and agreed milestones."""

EBRPD’s exhibit design process is malleable and with audience participation of questions specific to their needs, panel members will be able to show how the foundation of the template structure implements strong organization and communication around exhibit design that can be implemented by any level of project manager. This will provide many learning opportunities with members of the audience likely having similar situations."""

As an internal project management tool, it improves communication and defines expectations to all project stakeholders.

**From projects big and small, internal and external, the Exhibit Design Process is integral to successful exhibits. Learn how East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) defined their process and how they reshape it to fit projects with graphic panel to an entire Visitor Center. Joining EBRPD is Aldrich Pears and Associates (APA) to share how they collaborated using this process and how it improved communication and identified JEDAI touchpoints throughout each step.**
