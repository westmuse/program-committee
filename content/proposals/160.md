session_objectives = """In 2019, the Burke Museum turned itself Inside/Out, establishing new levels of openness in all aspects of museum practice. This session will focus on one key aspect of this model: a deeper engagement with cultural stakeholders, acknowledging the issues in our museum’s history and fully committing to creating opportunities and access for diverse communities. Session attendees will hear from the Burke’s Tribal Liaison (TL), Executive Director, and members of the Native American Advisory Board (NAAB), and will learn: *How community voices—primarily via the NAAB—led to the creation of the TL role and defined its place within our organizational structure;  *What decolonization looks like at the Burke, and how it affects not only cultural practices but also scientific research; and  *What new initiatives the TL has put into place and how this work has served to further the museum’s EID goals, elevate the profile of the NAAB, and support the Burke’s mission to “care for and share natural and cultural collections so all people can learn, be inspired, generate knowledge, feel joy, and heal.” Attendees will leave this session with:  *The Burke’s decolonization toolkit  *An understanding of how decolonization has relevance and implications that extend well beyond the curatorial and education departments. These wide-ranging interactions deepen cohesion and collegiality within and among museum departments and stakeholder groups.  Because this work cross-cuts the museum and is relevant to professionals at all levels, we encourage attendance from  departments across the institution: leadership, curatorial, administrative, education, etc."""
session_engagement = """The panel will engage the audience through storytelling and/or a story circle and an interactive format that provides time for reflection.

session_scalability = """The Burke’s approach to decolonization, which embeds Indigenous voices early on in museum decision-making of all types, is of value to those organizations that serve Indigenous communities through collections, programming, education, and other museum activities. By focusing on the process by which we came to turn our intentions into actions, we hope to provide a model that other institutions--regardless of size--can adapt and use to best meet the needs of their own internal and external constituencies.

Decolonization heals. Decolonization reconnects people to the natural environment. Decolonization finds common ground.  At the new Burke Museum, we are embedding Indigenous voices in all aspects of museum practice in ways that promote decolonization and contribute to meaningful systemic change. Join us for a conversation about how we are creating an institutional culture that values and reflects the input of a broader range of voices and thus meets the needs of a broader range of audiences.
