Learning Outcomes: Attendees will learn from this session: 
 
Why it is critical to collaborate with local tribes to enter into relationship and how to build upon that relationship to explore land acknowledgement within a museum space.
 
How to develop and present a land acknowledgment in the most compelling and meaningful way, including employ of indigenous language.
 
Practical steps to take around tribal consultation, content collaboration, and related program development when exploring or developing a land acknowledgement statement."""

It is because of many museums’ commitment to authenticity, transparency, and social justice that other organizations have been inspired to do truth-telling.

I have myself (as moderator) and one presenter (our tribal partner) confirmed, as well as a non-indigenous cultural museum, but would welcome input/referrals to others that have or are in the process of developing land acknowledgments - Ideally an art or science museum/org --- I would also be happy to merge with another session.

\*As moderator, I will be asking some in depth questions, since the SBCM and SMBMI worked on the land acknowledgment together. We thought it important to have the tribal representative have more time and space to present from their point of view.
