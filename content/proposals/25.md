1.	Building meaningful, mutually beneficial relationships between tribal and non-tribal museums
2.	Creating professional development opportunities to build capacity around indigenizing organizations.
3.	Indigenizing learning, evaluation, and institutions in a place-based, long-term, mutually beneficial manner.

Attendees will gain an understanding of how each process and context is so unique for tribal and non-tribal partnerships. Also, we have found that people tend to look for simple template or “best practices” when it’s more of a process that can be messy, unclear, and emergent. We will focus on ways to engage, challenges faced, and insights gained."""
session_engagement = """We thought that starting with short presentations from the participants perspectives would be helpful to then move into small, group and a think/pair/share with some prompting questions: What partnerships are they already engaged in? What partnerships might benefit their work around indigenizing? What does it mean to indigenize the museum? What’s driving that decision, and what does that look like? Is the institution ready and how would you know? Are you looking for marginal change or transformation?"""
session_scalability = """The outcomes are applicable to all institutions - we will present a process that can be adopted and adapted.

Many museums are working on indigenizing their work, programs, exhibitions and institutions. A clear path and protocol for this work does not yet exist to move our organizations forward.  Encouragingly, several institutions are working together in unique ways to find a path. In Central Oregon, two museums have a unique opportunity to use partnership, relationship building and creative professional development workshops to leverage their expertise and place-based focus. This session will provide clear insights about building relationships, moving partnerships forward between tribal and non-tribal institutions.
