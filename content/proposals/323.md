    a. through store design, engaged and informed staff, marketing, and product selection
    b. collaboration with curatorial and education departments
    c. how tax laws encourage the stores to focus on the museum mission
    d. understand the ways that museum stores, with their institutions, have worked to create memories and experiences that reverberate far beyond museum walls
    e. know that museum stores can both enhance the visitor experience and contribute financially to the institution while being responsive to the museum itself
2. Raise awareness of the many ways museum stores encourage and practice diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility through the wide range of books and products offered to visitors. The store staff can be more diverse than the museum itself and bring a unique perspective.
3. Understand the coordinated effort of the national initiative, Museum Store Sunday, on the part of museum store staff and museum administration to draw visitors into their institutions and financially support the programs of the museums."""
session_engagement = """Fishbowl conversation with the audience and a panel of museum store directors, one or more museum administrators such as a CFO, and professionals who work with museum stores. Visitor interaction role play with the audience will be included. The audience will be invited to tell stories of how curatorial/education staff have supported the activities of the museum store and how they see the store as supporting the activities of the museum."""
session_scalability = """All-sized museums will benefit from this lively conversation on the interconnectedness of institutions and their stores. Often, the store is seen as “something that visitors want” rather than an integral part of the institution’s mission and of the visitor experience. This is applicable whether it is a small nature center, a historical museum, or a large destination museum. There often is greater diversity in the store staff than in the institution itself, and these voices can bring important viewpoints that have been traditionally overlooked

The main point of contact that visitors often have is with security staff, housekeeping, the cafe, visitor services, and the store staff. Directors, curators, and administrators often do their work behind the scenes. Their interaction with the public is limited, but a dialogue between all can enhance the understanding of the visitors’ interests.  

There is a relationship between what the museum does and how it benefits the store. What the store does and how it benefits the museum can be developed and amplified by intramural communication, whether through marketing channels or exhibition discussion or other means. Neither exists separately from the other but this symbiotic relationship is often overlooked

Museum Stores are uniquely positioned to raise the institution's profile and are critical to the overall financial and educational health of the institution. They enhance visitor experience through store design, engaged/informed staff, marketing, and product selection. Hear how museum stores, together with their institutions, have worked to create memories that reverberate beyond museum walls and how the Museum Store Association’s Museum Store Sunday brings together museums across the country in support of their institutions.
