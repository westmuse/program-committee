session_unique = """Modern technology has contributed to a profound sense of alienation - can we leverage museum exhibits to create facilitated conversations, authentic connection and shared storytelling through deliberate design decisions that support human interaction and deeper, more empathic learning?"""
session_objectives = """1.      Exhibits that are “more” – discovering how exhibits can be rethought to support program extensions for different audiences.  Participants will learn about practical examples of how exhibits were deliberately designed or iterated to become a platform for program extensions for different audiences, and consider how this may apply at their own institutions.
 
2.      Networking and learning opportunities from peers at all levels and types of institutions. The panelists represent a range of different scales and types of museums, with different levels of experience within the field. During the roundtable breakout session, they will mediate conversations connected with the topic based on audience interest. Participants can use this to help build connections with a broad network of museum professionals who have experience designing and using these multimodal experiences in different circumstances.
 
 
3.      An opportunity to brainstorm, consider and experiment with colleagues how this model can be applied to your own institution. We hope this stimulates ideas and understanding of how challenges can be adapted to expand offerings for visitors to member museums of all different scales and types."""
session_engagement = """After brief case study introductions, the audience will join panelists in themed conversation tables exploring approaches to relevant scenarios suggested by participants, digging into real examples and practical cases that draw on everyone’s collective experience. At the conclusion, audience participants will lead the share out."""
session_scalability = """In a museum, the human layer makes everything better – considering how exhibits can be extended, iterated and molded to support conversation and program based learning applies to all institutions – the duality of these experiences means they stand alone when no staff or volunteers are present, but can be activated in different and more intimate ways in the hands of a knowledgeable and skilled facilitator (both paid and volunteer staff).  The examples cited here will encompass a range of museum scales - from a small , community children's museum to some of the largest museums on the West Coast, to designs for medium scaled science centers and beyond.  The panelists will also highlight how this exhibit program duality can be used to connect with specific audiences that the exhibit on its own may miss.

**How can you help your exhibits deliver “more” for your visitors? We will explore case studies of how exhibits have been developed as platforms for both unfacilitated and facilitated learning opportunities. How do we turn neurology puzzles into a sensory brain bar? A story nook into a community conversation spot? A playful roleplay spot into a cultural heritage moment? We will then break into mediated roundtables with participants to explore exhibit/program scenarios suggested by attendees.**
