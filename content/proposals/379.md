**There are many areas of intersection between the missions and activities of state humanities councils and state museum associations.  Humanities councils offer programs, grants, and access to national initiatives; state museum associations provide support services, including communication networks, professional development, and advocacy.  These are often the first resources accessed by smaller museums beyond their own staff and boards.  Exploring the work of both groups will expand awareness of these important museum resources, and opportunities for collaboration. **
