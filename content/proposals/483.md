In particular, when we build from each other's knowledge and experiences, then it is possible to find ways to examine and  tackle pervasive broader issues such as disaster risk reduction and climate change. In that regard, the hope of this session is to inspire participants to connect and consider what ways they can improve and co-create that is achievable and not taunting. 

- Awareness of size bite step approaches that position community members and museum practitioners as co-creators for risk resilience learning. 
- Awareness of community members valuable assets such as situational awareness, their roles, and networks. 
- Fostering connections with museum practitioners seeking to collaborate with communities in co- creating educational activities (in the form of demos or other) in which community members can ideate, prioritize their preferences, and inform approaches for both educational activities and evaluation."""
session_engagement = """The intended audience participation strategies for this session include: 
1. Fostering and facilitating peer conversations inspired by stories of approaches used by museum practitioners (using role play)
2. Participants will engage and come up with approaches used to collaborate with community members  and interact  as if they were community members, and/or museum practitioners trying to co-create or improve  an educational experience.
3. Resources needed:
    a. Round tables with chairs
    b. Microphones
    c. paper chart and sticky notes"""
session_scalability = """Museums of all sizes are exploring ways to connect with their communities and deepen relationships. The approaches shared in this session can be adapted to conversations with groups of about 5 to 15 people at once, then repeated as many times as needed with as many organizations needed for particular initiatives, projects, or programs. These approaches can work with community planning sessions, museum education, research, or evaluation experiences. For example, programming approaches  that already exist in museums can be adapted and improved to elicit ways in which community members articulate their priorities in relation to their location and collective identity.

Approaches associated with co-development of educational experiences are not new in the museum field. However, the focus has been on cognitive outcomes achieved through these experiences. As such, we are limiting our offerings  while at the same time not acknowledging the vast community members' assets and the ways in which they learn. In this hands-on session, panelists will share their experience and interest with dimensions such as social (networks), situational awareness, and role identity.
