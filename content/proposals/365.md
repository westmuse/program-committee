session_objectives = """1. Attendees will learn about the various studies and due-diligence that are appropriate to precede design as well as what it takes to solicit, evaluate, and engage a design and technical team with roles and responsibilities for all phases of a project.
2. Attendees will learn how to develop and right-size an architectural program that is comprehensive, achievable, and sustainable in all forms.
3. Attendees will learn how to anticipate and manage cost issues from pre-design through completion, and how to evaluate the appropriateness of various delivery methods (design-bid-building, CM-at-risk, design-build) for their project."""
session_engagement = """In addition to the PowerPoint presentation, attendees will be provided with workbooks for notetaking, as well as various activities that will occur throughout the workshop. All activity materials will be provided by the presenters."""
session_scalability = """Imagine you are a museum director or curator AND you are also the world’s leading expert in the field of paleontology, or math, or art. Now, imagine that you have the incredible opportunity of being tasked with a major museum building project. But you have never done this before, and you don’t know where to start! 
Here, at SmithGroup, we are incredibly fortunate that our Cultural Practice gets to work with all sorts of experts on projects all the time. Our museum clients and potential clients may be experts in their respective fields, but chances are, they have never done a museum project before. That’s because major museum projects only come along every 25-40 years – once in a lifetime. Since we maintain a studio that is devoted to cultural work, we have extensive experience.
We realized that these experts may need help, basic education, a tool kit – and may not even know who to ask, or where to find assistance. So, we began the Ready Aim Build Workshop Series and developed it with a group of colleagues, a collective of consulting museum experts – exhibition designers, museum planners, structural engineers, cost planners, general contractors, owner’s representatives, and strategic planners - with whom we work on projects.  
The Cultural Planning Collective runs the Ready Aim Build Workshop, or “how to make a museum class”, at AAM, MAAM, and other venues. We can scale it and tailor it for individual institution needs, offering full day, half day, or hour-long conversations. We have also teamed with former museum directors who have provided extra insight as guest speakers.
 
The workshop walks participants step by step through an idealized museum project – from planning, to design, to installation, construction, and beyond opening day. The Collective presents topics that may be pitfalls to projects, and provides questions, examples, and plenty of time for conversation and discussion.
