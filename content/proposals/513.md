Join us for a lively, interactive session on tracking-and-timing (T&T), a long-standing method for understanding visitor behavior in museums. We’ll break down how T&T works, its impact on exhibit evaluation, and how it continues to be a valuable tool. Then, in an engaging discussion, we’ll explore how this method could evolve to better align with new technologies, changing visitor behaviors, and modern exhibit design—bringing fresh possibilities to a time-tested approach.
