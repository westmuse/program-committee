2) Learn how to design standards-aligned exhibition-inspired curriculum that can be used with or without a museum visit that is appropriate for distance learning as well as how to utilize virtual professional-development workshops to show educators how to implement this curriculum in their classrooms.
3) Discover ways to design a multi-faceted community engagement strategy that takes the learning objectives of an exhibition outside the museum walls and involves diverse community partners."""

The Oregon Historical Society’s (OHS) original exhibition, _[Nevertheless, They Persisted: Women’s Voting Rights and the 19th Amendment](https://www.ohs.org/museum/exhibits/nevertheless-they-persisted.cfm)_, was slated to open the day OHS closed its doors due to COVID-19. In this panel discussion, staff and community partners will share how flexible educational curriculum, valuable community partnerships, and a shift in marketing priorities from visitor conversion to mission delivery made _Nevertheless, They Persisted_ arguably one of OHS’s most successful exhibits in terms of broad access.
