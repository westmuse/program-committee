  **Indigenous museums are entrusted with an important role within their communities which is the continuation and revitalization of lifeways. The Huhugam Ki: Museum and Huhugam Heritage Center partnered together to hold their first Baithaj (Saguaro fruit) harvest in the summer of 2023. The presenters will share how two indigenous museums are collaborating to ensure that harvesting of native foods continues into the future. **
