session_objectives = """This workshop has three primary learning objectives that we center around the questions:

1. What is participatory design?
2. Why is participatory design critical in this current political moment?
3. How can we implement participatory design in exhibitions and programs at a variety of scales and contexts?

To achieve these goals we divide the workshop into two segments: an introduction to theory and methodology, followed by a hands-on opportunity to put the concepts learned into practice. In the first section, participants will be introduced to Obvious Agency’s unique methodology for participatory design, explore a case study of the method in practice at the Barnes Foundation, and learn the values-based concepts that underlie this approach. Within this we will unpack the traditional museum-patron relationship, and explore how participatory design and co-creative frameworks act as democracy-in-practice. Participants will leave with an understanding of how this approach can normalize the idea that culture is something that is collectively created while still allowing museums to be experts in particular subject areas; and how long-term buy-in increases when a museum’s audience has a clear and active role to play in the life of the institution.

In the second section, participants will apply what they have learned by rapidly prototyping and testing miniature participatory exhibits of their own. Participants will then collectively unpack what worked well, what was challenging, and how the ideas that were put into practice come into contact with the norms we practice at our home institutions."""
session_engagement = """This session is participatory and pulls primarily from the creativity of the attendees. We use a learning-by-doing approach: providing tools and concepts to attendees and then giving them a low-stakes and disposable opportunity to practice. The culminating activity has participants working in small groups to co-create a diverse array of mini-exhibitions, allowing participants to experience and reflect on the process and outcome of participatory design."""
session_scalability = """The concepts and tools provided in this workshop are scalable to organizations and projects of any scale and budget size. They have been used on projects with budgets under $5k and over $150k. What we offer is a framework and approach towards conceptualizing participatory exhibitions and programs, and the unique context of an organization can always inform the process and outcome.

Fascism is here, and it thrives when everyday people take on passive roles. What might be possible if instead of training our patrons to be attendees, we gave them a critical and co-creative role in the cultural experience? In this hands-on workshop participants will learn how participatory and co-creative design lead to more engaging exhibitions and programs, build deeper and more durable relationships with patrons, and can train people towards active and generative civic participation.
