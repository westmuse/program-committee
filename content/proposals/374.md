session_objectives = """Attendees will learn how a diverse group of community and university partners joined together as a cohort of learners to understand Augmented Reality and use this tool to create a series of 10 geographically dispersed AR exhibit experiences, a website, and related writing activities. The panelists, from Arizona State Museum (an anthropology museum), the Tucson Chinese Cultural Center, the Dunbar Pavilion (African American center), the University of Arizona’s Center for Digital Humanities, and perhaps other cohort partners, will share how they took on the challenge of learning about this new tech tool, and the opportunities that arose in doing so. We will look at the variety of ways we tackled taking AR from a concept to reality by unpacking how the project developed and was implemented, including looking at the themes we identified, how poetry was intertwined in the project, design and signage considerations, tech skills, and how each particular AR exhibit brought diverse community voices to the public. We’ll look at how we leveraged resources of the University to empower smaller community organizations and build relationships among the partners. We will share challenges encountered and the outcomes, and address how these types of projects can be springboards for collaboration and innovation, and expand museum engagement for visitors and community. Attendees will be able to experience AR themselves and consider how these tools can make collections, archives, and community stories more accessible, dynamic, and exciting for their visitors too.
Note: Additional cohort partners may also join the session, and some of the UA students too."""
session_engagement = """The audience will learn from the panel discussion, Q & A, and by trying the various AR experiences themselves. After trying the AR, they will work in small groups to identify ideas for AR incorporation in their museums, as well who they might collaborate with on such a project. For this to be successful, strong wifi will be needed and attendees will need to use their smartphones or tablets."""

University, museum, and community partners will share how this cohort of learners created geographically dispersed Augmented Reality (AR) experiences around the theme of community in the Borderlands. Discover what AR is, the diverse skills required to create these types of projects, the challenges of using new technology, and how to develop linked content. Hear community partners share what the collaborative meant to them. Attendees will try the Discovering Community in the Borderlands AR experiences.
