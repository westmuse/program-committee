session_objectives = """The worsening climate crisis has pushed museums to rethink their role in climate awareness, turning that awareness into action. Inspired by the lead that youth have taken in climate action, the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) has explored a symbiotic collaboration model for museums and youth regarding climate change and potentially broader themes of socioeconomic interest.

The innovative “YARB,” or Youth Advisory Research Board model, combines Youth Advisory Boards (YABs), which support youth voice implementation in museums, and Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR), which supports youth in designing and conducting research of their interest. Thus, YARBs present an opportunity to learn from youth activism while supporting social movements in ways not normally accessible for youth. While a YARB can address a number of socioeconomic themes, OMSI focused its first YARB program on climate change.

The objectives of this session are:
1. Attendees and facilitators will have a better understanding of the opportunities and potential challenges implementing a YARB in their institutions.
2. Attendees will understand how museums can position themselves in climate action efforts, seeking opportunities that resonate with youth 
3. Attendees will broaden their professional network and build relationships with others interested in engaging with youth researchers.
4. Attendees will discuss and brainstorm ideas of engaging and working with youth in a museum setting"""
session_engagement = """Participants will be grouped in sub-groups and be encouraged to ask questions and share any concerns about implementing a YARB in their institutions.
Resources needed are ample space and chairs arranged in groups of 6-8."""
session_scalability = """The YARB model can be adapted to different types of institutions, and YARBs can have from 3 to 15 youth  members. Themes addressed do not have to revolve around climate change, but can address a number of social phenomena that are of interest to youtube such as equity, or freedom of speech. The outcomes of the session will provide learning for professionals that work in different kinds of museums.

The future of museums as meaningful institutions lies in shifting away from neutrality, addressing social topics of interest. OMSI led an exploratory, symbiotic_ Youth Advisory Research Board_ focusing on climate change education. 
The goal of this session is to share lessons learned, best practices, and challenges. This session will be useful to attendees interested in youth programming and social action. Key aspects explored are program design and development, youth as researchers/advisors, and youth-created programming.
