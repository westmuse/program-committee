Join us for an evening of Kumeyaay games!  Traditionally, Kumeyaay People played gambling games in the evenings as a way of redistributing resources.  Today, they're fun games (whether you bet or not!) and help reinforce traditional culture and the use of the Native language, 'Iipay Aa.  Let's play "Shahuuk 'Emaay Sarraap" (you'll decorate your own game piece with a Kumeyaay design), "Pshok" (you'll decorate your own dice to take home), and "Hemay" ('Iipay Aa Bingo.)  There will be prizes, of course!  Bring the kids, all ages are welcome!
