**How do you roll out an interpretive framework at an organization that has existed for 40 years but never had an overarching interpretive plan? We’ll share some tools and approaches we used and how we did it! It’s also an opportunity to consider how you can apply these ideas to your organization, department, or your individual work. This session provides opportunities for professionals at all levels as well as across disciplines and departments. Interpretive planning is for everyone!**
