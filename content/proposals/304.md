How do we make 250th anniversary relevant in the western states of the US? Our presenters will share at what stage their state and/or organizations are in the celebration/recognition of American 250?

As colleagues, we will brainstorm how to start, implement, and continue beyond American 250 and discuss how to include a diverse community into the celebration. As a reference, we are utilizing the publication, _Making History at 250: The Field Guide for the Semiquincentennial _by  American Association for State and Local History.
