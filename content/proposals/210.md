We are in the process of developing and refining tools and processes that provide broad access and utility to help guide the long-term work of appropriate community collaboration and consultation in the small museum context. Our session objectives are to collect region-wide information about what methods or structures work in other areas, as well as to hear new ideas we may not have thought of. This is not a NAGPRA session, nor is it strictly indigenous, as the underpinnings of good community collaboration can be applied in many different situations and in varying types of organizations. Good ideas and illuminating experiences can come from anywhere. Our hope is that others can contribute or borrow strategies for good community collaboration to create better exhibits, more meaningful and truthful interpretation, and more appropriate storage solutions for their collections after hearing what others in the room have learned."""

The Utah Divisions of Indian Affairs, Arts & Museums, and State History with Utah Humanities have begun partnering to assist Utah museums in becoming better stewards of tribal objects in collections. We are creating resources to help identify objects (prehistoric through contemporary) they may have in their collections. We want to hear how museums and designated tribal representatives can be supported to begin a process of community consultation and practice of shared museum authority.
