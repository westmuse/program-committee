session_objectives = """OVERVIEW
The importance of maintaining institutional knowledge. Several real-world methods will be examined. The audience will walk away with actionable options for maintaining institutional knowledge.
STAFFING
Experienced and trained staff with high morale means fewer mistakes are made, the design, development and installation of exhibits is quicker, and the end result is highly engaging for the visitor. The audience will walk away with actionable ideas for onboarding new staff as well as retaining experienced staff. 
INNOVATION
Without the building blocks of previous work history (the institutional knowledge) coupled with experienced and efficient staff, innovation can stall. Some prerequisites to innovation will be outlined and the audience will learn to recognize opportunities to help it flourish. 
The audience will come away with methods of fostering and encouraging innovation in a time and budget friendly way.
HANDS ON 
Demonstrations by the panelists will provide new techniques and demystify materials. It furthers the notion that when we connect and share it helps everyone.
QUESTIONS
The audience will walk away with answers to their “burning” questions. A mechanism will be provided to collect and answer all questions if we can’t get to all of them in the session."""
session_engagement = """The first half is devoted to practical applications of institutional knowledge.
The second half will be devoted to a demonstration of techniques with room for audience inquires. The audience is expected to come prepared with “burning” questions about practical aspects of the design and installation of exhibits. Colleagues in the room will attempt to rapid-fire answer these conundrums. We will have items that the audience can take away to solidify their experience."""
session_scalability = """No matter the museum size or type, designing and physically bringing an exhibit to life shares many of the same resources and employee know-how. Some of us wear many hats in a small organization, others are niched down in a large institution. This session suggests that any museum exhibit professional should record and share their knowledge both inside and outside their organization. All of us in the museum trade will benefit and there will be fewer time that we have t reinvent the wheel.
