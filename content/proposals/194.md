Threats to cultural institutions and their collections can be unpredictable and preparing for any eventuality is an important part of collections stewardship. Step one is to come up with a flexible plan that provides clear instructions in the event of a disaster. This session will walk participants through the construction of an emergency response plan and provide them with supporting resources and a framework to build a robust and flexible disaster plan for their institution.
