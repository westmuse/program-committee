In this hands-on workshop, we will remediate damaged paper-based items (books, photographs, and archives). After a brief training, the group will dry drenched books and photographs, remove soot from smoke-damaged paper, and triage damaged archives. We will end with a discussion of best practices and what was learned in the training, options for other paper-based risks such as pests and mold, and create preliminary disaster plans for paper-based items in individual collections.
