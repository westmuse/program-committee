session_objectives = """Interest in mindfulness has grown exponentially in the last decade. Studies have shown numerous health and societal benefits. At their core, museums provide a space for visitors to pause. Facilitated experiences, including slow looking, discussions, meditation, artmaking, spending time in nature, and creative responses, encourage visitors to carefully look, engage in conversation, and learn about diverse viewpoints. These programs foster connections, belongingness, and compassion—capacities at the center of the human experience and vital for mental health and well-being. The techniques shared are applicable to any museum, botanical garden, zoo, and historical site. In addition, this session will discuss ways to bring mindfulness into our work as museum professionals. Building in time to pause, reflect and find balance in our work helps staff sustain creativity, purpose, and joy. 

The aim of this interactive session is to introduce mindfulness programming in expected and unexpected ways, to give participants the tools to brainstorm and plan mindfulness programs, either by incorporating into existing programming or starting a new program, and to find ways to bring mindfulness into their daily work. 
Throughout the session, participants will be encouraged to draw and/or embroider. (materials will be provided) 
The session will begin with a short meditation and contemplation through slow looking at art. (no tech needed) 
The panelists will present various successful programs and techniques they developed and current research. Followed by guided break-out groups, time for questions, share-out and reflection."""

Mindfulness in museums is a timely topic—from meditation programming to cultivating connections among audiences, to writing and artmaking activities, there are many opportunities for museums to provide meaningful programs that support wellness and balance for their audiences and staff. Join educators with over fifteen years experience for a participatory session that will include activities such as slow looking, artmaking, deep discussion, and handouts.
