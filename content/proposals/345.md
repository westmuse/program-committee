Share a mean tweet, online review, visitor comment card, performance appraisal, museum secret or wish and then drop it into the fire and let it burn!. The cleansing flames will burn away the negativity and like phoenixes (_or in this case down the road from Phoenix_) we will all rise from the ashes and fly into the future full of positivity and optimism!
