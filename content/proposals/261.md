session_objectives = """During this session, participants will be introduced to the building
blocks of Empathetic Practice, develop shared language for this
necessary work, and explore DEIA issues and critically access their own
empathetic practice as explored through different lenses (personal,
cultural, institutional).
Our workshop experiences include:
● A deep dive into typical museum culture, policies, and norms;
● understand the key characteristics of empathy as they apply
to museums at various stages of maturity;
● be able to articulate why a museum should be interested in
empathy and the benefits of empathetic practice to a
museum and its community;
● be able to assess the state of their own museum’s empathy
using their own experiences to articulate the conditions and
competencies necessary for their institution to build and
sustain empathy;
● develop insights to effectively analyze, plan for and EFFECT
change in their museums and communities;
● have confidence to apply The Empathetic Museum maturity
model to a museum to diagnose the state of its empathetic
practice and to identify and dissect issues impacting the
museum’s relationship with its community;
● be empowered to bring the concept of institutional empathy
back to a participant’s museum/department and help others
discover the concept and its importance."""
session_engagement = """This session invites participants to begin an unflinching reflection of
institutional empathy within their organizations through the
characteristics of an empathetic museum and engages participants in
an honest assessment of institutional practices. Participants will
develop skills in a hands-on lab experience. We will be using printed
workbooks, markers, post-its (poster sized, small) at interactive
learning stations."""
session_scalability = """The qualities of 21st century museums are impossible without
an inner core of institutional empathy: the intention of the
museum to be, and be perceived as, deeply connected with its
community. As practitioners continue to tackle issues of equity,
representation, and power within their organizations, the Empathetic Museum offers skills and structures to support our ever-changing field.

The Empathetic Museum specializes in increasing organizational and
individual capacity for empathetic practice. After many years of
consulting, the Empathetic Museum team has co-designed a workbook
and invites you to extend your empathetic practice and give us
feedback. This is a space to learn, try, and experiment with
organizational empathy without judgment. Join us for this extended
working group session.
