session_objectives = """1.)   Attendees will learn how LED light is different from traditional halogen sources and what that means for collection exhibition and conservation. This will be done from a technical standpoint as well as using a demonstration system.
2.)   The presentation will discuss and demonstrate the impact of lighting styles and color on perception. Attendee feedback will be incorporated through the use of anonymous, electronic voting/feedback software to provide a chance for audience participation.
3.)	With the evolving technology landscape around the lighting marketplace, it is easy to make an exhibit lighting system smarter and more operational friendly. This presentation will demonstrate and discuss ways this can be add both tangible and intangible value."""
session_engagement = """Ideally this would occur at a museum or gallery space where a demonstration could occur using an existing exhibition or artwork. If selected, ERCO would provide all of the necessary lighting equipment (fixtures, track, etc.) as well as electronic feedback technology mentioned previously. The session would include time for verbal feedback as well as discussions. The presentation would not seek to provide a specific answer or right/wrong but rather a launch pad for each institution."""

We believe this sort of conversation is important due to the role of light in a museum and its impact of the artwork. While we do have an independent lighting designer/consultant as part of our panel, we would be happy to include a curator or visitor experience voice in the workshop.**

**While you might not always draw a straight line from lighting to visitor experience, there are countless ways that that system influences the museum environment. Much of influence is changing with LEDs and new technology. To harness this, one must identify the role of lighting in the who, when, what, why, where, and how of your collection, mission, and visitors. This practical workshop will demonstrate, discuss, and posit the role of lighting in those answers.**
