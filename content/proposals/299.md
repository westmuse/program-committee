Every collecting organization has an artifact that provokes the question, “what do we do with this?” or “how should we do this?” From STEAM collections to history or art collections, this session will explore the different ways to care for collection oddities. WMA and the Registrars Committee-Western Region (RCWR) team up to present case studies on specific artifacts, lessons learned, and strategies for caring for the unusual artifacts in your collection.
