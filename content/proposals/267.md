Despite decades of raising awareness, gender-based issues in the museum field remain; inequality, discrimination, and sexual harassment are often daily occurrences. Join members of the Gender Equity in Museums Movement (GEMM) steering committee to tackle issues YOU are seeing in your workplace right now. Together, in small groups, we will listen to an issue raised by a colleague and brainstorm solutions. You will leave with new ideas for
approaching current or future challenges and with a renewed sense of solidarity with colleagues.
