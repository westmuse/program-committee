I will introduce Post Provenance and demonstrate Resonance Indexing, a forward-looking framework that reimagines how museums analyze, contextualize, and communicate collection histories. Participants will explore practical applications, from AI-assisted archival analysis to audience-driven interpretation strategies, enabling more transparent, inclusive, and future-proof collection stewardship.
