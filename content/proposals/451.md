Session attendees will leave with exclusive access to our written guide (when completed) to inform their own work and guide data clean-up at their home organizations.

Objective 2: Feedback from attendees will be solicited, encouraging them to consider data best practices as they would apply to their own collection. Outcome is a more informed standard to more broadly benefit all collecting institutions as well as more informed and confident participants who will have started thinking about how to improve their data to aid in NAGPRA work.

Objective 3: Participants will learn more about CMS functionality that can aid in consultation and repatriation efforts to ideally make improvements to their local systems to support NAGPRA work."""
