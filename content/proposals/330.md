session_objectives = """In this session, or roundtable, both Museum professionals and Tribal representatives would engage in the discussion about the role that Museums would play in terms of Cultural Representation, and the importance of Tribal administrators where it comes to public representation. In this area of southern California, it would be particularly ideal for the idea of an emerging Museum of Indigenous Culture to bring together tribal leaders, anthropologists, museum administrators, historians and educators together to discuss the roles within the museums and institutions, and how that impacts society for the public good."""
session_engagement = """Discussion among tribal representatives of how engagement with institutions can lead to cultural understanding and accurate representation, and the challenges associated with correcting colonial colored historical narratives (reclaiming 'lost histories')  Question and Answer sessions, surveys of participant experiences in their relative institutions, and visual displays of tribal culture."""
session_scalability = """### With efforts to ‘de-colonize’ the narratives that historically been present in many institutions, the example of ‘getting it right’ with an emerging museum would be beneficial for all. Additionally, opportunities for understanding and the need for research would enhance active collaborations between institutions and underrepresented tribal communities using an emerging/proposed museum (the Museum of Indigenious Culture and Natural History) as a working platform.

### **Tribal participation in Museums….what does it look like from an administrative perspective, and how do we engage tribal leaders where it comes to pan tribal histories? Within the museum industry what are the career paths for tribal culture keepers and how that can impact traditional **living **cultural understandings? Presenting such understandings and research as an important function of collective tribal cultures makes the public representations of Museums relevant and sustaining.**
