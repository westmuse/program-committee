session_objectives = """OBJECTIVE #1:  Understand the history of pay equity from the “equal pay for equal work” movement that resulted in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 through the current mainstream acceptance of DEI policies in the workplace.

OBJECTIVE #2:  Learn what is involved in implementing pay equity in your museum.  This involves conducting a study of all positions and their respective responsibilities and duties, obtaining comparative data from similar positions in similarly situated industries and professions, and evaluating each position’s pay based in the individual employee’s education and experience, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other statuses.  Also important is an understanding of how pay equity differs from pay raises.

OBJECTIVE #3:  Understand how implementing pay equity fits into a larger DEI policy, its benefits, and its challenges, particularly prioritization of resources (i.e., with a limited budget, who receives pay equity adjustments first?) and education of staff."""
session_engagement = """Although it’s been the law since 1963, emphasis on DEI has redefined the boundaries of pay equity.  This is a relatively new topic for which there is not a lot of reliable, nonprofit-specific information.  Accordingly, the intended audience participation will be a traditional passive audience format with time for audience Q&A reserved."""
session_scalability = """The general principles apply to institutions of all sizes.  The strategies for prioritization of pay equity implementation and conservation of resources will be particularly relevant to smaller museums with limited budgets, but will also be applicable to larger museums as well.

**Pay Equity is the principle of compensating employees of similar job functions equally on the basis of education, experience, and responsibilities regardless of age, race, sexual orientation, or other statuses.  Pay equity falls under a museum’s DEI (Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion) policy, but its implementation poses challenges to museums regardless of staff size or composition.  This session presents the benefits and challenges of implementing pay equity in your museum, and offers practical guidance for getting started.**
