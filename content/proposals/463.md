Session participants will identify the leadership skills and traits most often used within the leadership styles shared. They will be able to assess their own skill levels at this time, and apply these skills back at work.

Session participants will broaden their personal networks during the small group portion of the program, where they’ll have real discussion with colleagues old and new. They will connect with other participants and the panel, share their experiences, and learn how others have managed similar situations."""

There are many ways to lead. Some of us have a go-to style of leadership, and some of us are still trying them on.. Join us to talk leadership styles, and when to use them. This panel brings together four museum leaders to share their stories - the wins, the losses, and everything in between. Join the conversation, and share yours, too. We’ll all leave with ideas, resources, and inspiration.
