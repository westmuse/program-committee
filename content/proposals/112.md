session_objectives = """1) The intended audience for this session includes any museum professional who wishes to engage in inclusion, and equity work, whether in a large progressive city or a conservative small town. Based on discussion in small breakout groups, audience members will develop their own ideas about how to bring more inclusive practices and audience engagement techniques to museums of all sizes, disciplines, and geographic locations. Participants should glean at least a couple of concrete ideas that they could try to implement in their museum. 2) Participants will develop a sense of community and shared purpose by meeting other professionals who are struggling with the very same challenges of how to engage in inclusion and equity work when they are being told by their boss or their board that they can’t do anything partisan at work, anything that takes a stance on a particular issue, or sometimes, even express an opinion outside of work. By growing their network, participants will gain new resources to call upon when they are back in their museum and encounter a challenge when trying to advance inclusion in their institution. 3) By going beyond the foundational concept that no organization or person is neutral, the session will investigate the contrasting realities faced by museum professionals from big cities to small towns, progressive bubbles to conservative strongholds. Participants and presenters will expand the conversation about the perceived or purported neutrality of museums to explore the tensions in their own institutions and the field at large."""

Takeaways will include: 1. A reading list (exact titles TBD) 2. Compilation of notes from each of the breakout groups. 3.  Resources from the Cultural Advocacy Coalition of Oregon."""

Building off the 2019 session, Museums are Places that are Quietly Subversive, thought leaders in the field will explore the tensions between pushing the activism boundary and maintaining the public trust. How can our organizations tackle exclusive practices and systems, and actively engage in inclusive practices without alienating existing audiences, the people who most need to hear the message? Can a museum engage in inclusion work or nullify exclusionary practices without taking an activist stance?
