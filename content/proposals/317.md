1.  Learn about the structure and relationship of the governing board (or trustees), management, staff, and the state (yes, the state in which a museum resides possesses a little-known but powerful supervisory role in all 50 states!)
2. Understand the duties of board members and the division of responsibilities between directors/trustees and staff.
3. Learn about best practices relating to board governance and oversight of museum operations."""
session_engagement = """Participants will be immersed in a role-playing activity where they will make decisions and realize outcomes as board members.  The take-away will be that participants will have a clear understanding of what a board does and doesn't do, and why both boards and staff play complementary roles in the well-being and success of the museum.  The presenters will draw upon their real-life experience from the Bishop Museum's highly publicized board meltdown last year."""
