It is far more than a slate of virtual programming, rather it is a cohesive vision and plan for an entire organization that supports mission-driven work. It is also important for attendees to understand how a digital strategy complements activities in the physical museum space while not serving as a substitute for an in-person visit.
2.    Attendees will leave the session with a clear understanding of how to begin the process of developing a digital strategy by identifying internal and external goals and objectives, establishing timelines for developing and implementing a strategy, and approaching digital in a scalable way that is appropriate for their specific organization.
3.    Attendees will return to their organization empowered with a “best practices tool kit” including technology tools and tips to help organizations of all sizes, source materials for reference, and a checklist so organizations can focus on what they need to do to move forward with developing a digital strategy for their museum."""

Museums crafting digital strategies for the first time can find the process daunting so hearing from members of the museum community who have done this work can be a great place to start. This session will address how an institution can develop a successful digital strategy, including how to leverage technology for institutional impact, how to ensure digital efforts are serving a need, and how digital efforts can protect, enhance, and showcase content.
