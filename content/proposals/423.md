- To share the complex challenges of leading a museum/cultural institution today. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of these challenges.  
- To make the case for why self-care is so important within the context of museum/cultural institution leadership. Attendees will leave with a deeper appreciation of the interconnections amongst self-care, leadership, and sustainability. 
- To provide examples of specific self-care strategies and practices that different museum/cultural institution leaders rely upon to support sustainability.  Attendees will leave with a toolbox of strategies and practices that can inform their own approach to leadership."""

Museum leaders have so many different kinds of people they must take care of that they often forget to take care of themselves. Putting on our own oxygen masks first can feel counter-intuitive, but it’s a cornerstone of sustainable leadership. It also models to others what well-being can look like. Join us for an honest conversation about our struggles, strategies, practices, and – on a good day – triumphs as we try our best to keep sane in the insane world of museum leadership today.
