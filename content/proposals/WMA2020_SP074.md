The museum’s new strategic direction aims to inspire its visitors to be agents of social justice and active participants of democracy. As a space to facilitate informal learning and dialogue about historical and contemporary issues, JANM’s strength–like other museums–is its ability to interpret the past to inform the present and future. Various technologies are critical to furthering this work. JANM is experimenting with technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality to make the artifacts in the permanent collection–and the stories hinged to them–more accessible to a broader audience. As a result of experimenting with these technologies and incorporating them into its exhibitions and educational programs, JANM can share the lessons learned with other forward thinking institutions."""
