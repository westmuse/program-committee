How do museums and historians shape a person’s legacy, for better or for worse? Join us for small group conversations as we investigate the stories of aviation pioneers Pancho Barnes and Amelia Earhart through an LBGTQ+ perspective. We’ll consider the wider challenges of representing the diverse ethnicities or sexual/gender identities of historical individuals with today’s language, and examine how what museums say (and don’t say) about a person’s life has a profound impact on visitors.
