Working in museums and non-profits is often a labor of love. We do it because it matters – and often, we pour everything we have into that work. But what do you do for yourself? How do you refill your inner well of ideas, passion, and creativity?

In this session, we’ll explore lots of ways to elevate your self-care practice by slowing down, breathing, writing, moving, and creating – even when it feels impossible.
