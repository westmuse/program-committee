1) why it is important to focus on anti-ageism across the organization when developing creative aging programs (with examples of training and programs);
2) how to assess interests for participation in the museum among the fastest growing audience in the U.S. today -- adults 55+ (with examples of what they have said);
3) how to emulate/adapt the model program to their museums."""

People will use their own cell phones to personally participate in questions that will lead to the discovery of crucial information underpinning the need for anti-ageism initiatives.  Specific examples will be interwoven within the game.  Pair-and-share discussion prompts for participants to talk about together and then share with the larger group will engage them with ways they can emulate/adapt these ideas at their own organizations.  Ample time for a question-and-answer session will further personalize/customize participant learning."""

Balance the needs of adults 55 and better with those of the museum.  Reframe your relationship with older adults to help combat the epidemic of loneliness, social isolation, and ageism, while deepening your bond with the fastest growing segment of our society, the "forgotten generation." In less than a decade, for the first time in history, Americans older than 65 will out-number those under 18, according to the U.S. Dept. of Commerce.
