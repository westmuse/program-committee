2- Leverage rather than compete with those having expertise outside of our own. Create a path for linear vs nonlinear processes to coexist and be good stewards of our clients funds by providing the best possible outcomes for the project.  

3- Embrace a holistic exhibit model, because it is beneficial to an organization in terms of efficiency and outcome. How we communicate with the entire team, how we collectively commit to key milestones, and the responsibilities of all team members using an accountability model such as RACI."""
