Museum programs should be accessible to all, yet they are treated like a luxury. Barriers to participation have been exacerbated in the last year. To reach out to underserved or marginalized communities, it is important to co-create programs with organizations already serving these populations, and create authentic partnerships that are founded in humility and service. Our organizations learned to embrace their vulnerability as we created spaces for transformative learning experiences without prescribing their outcomes.
