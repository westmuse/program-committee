session_objectives = """1.) Our country’s founding fathers carefully created the constitution to institute a governing body with limited powers, with specific checks and balances. Executive Order 9066, signed by President Roosevelt in 1942, authorized the military to mass incarcerate over 125,000 people (1/3 American citizens) without due process. Why is this important today?

2.) Many individuals and families who lived through wartime incarceration were too traumatized to share their experiences until a generation later. What are some of the impacts of collecting community stories and sharing them (with permission) in public spaces?

3.) As the generation who lived through the WWII Japanese American concentration camps pass on, it has become increasingly important to build partnerships with other institutions and intentionally recalibrate our messages to non-Japanese Americans. What are the challenges and the successes we’ve found in engaging with audiences outside of our ethnic community?"""

The Japanese American WWII incarceration experience is a cautionary tale of an ugly chapter in American history. In a climate that encourages feel-good, unifying narratives, how do museums confront points of America’s dark past and integrate them into their exhibits and programs? How are community stories of injustice and tragedy essential to our country’s wellbeing? We’ll hear from a panel representing the Japanese American National Museum, the Topaz Museum, Heart Mountain Wyoming Interpretive Center, and the Amache Museum, then open up the floor to participants who face similar challenges in their own museums.
