session_objectives = """Objectives:
1)   Participants will hear and discuss how local communities of practice responded to a variety of challenges during the COVID pandemic
2) Participants will collaboratively consider and discuss ways to create and support their agency in professional development – even without the support of formal structures- by using local communities of practice. 
3) Participants will identify actionable steps they can take to seek or build community resources for professional learning.   
Outcomes:
Participants will connect and converse with presenters and each other, and through this impromptu community of practice, reflect on the changes to our field and their experiences over the last few years, and how to develop and engage in responsive and locally meaningful professional development within their own networks, to better serve their immediate local professional needs.
Take-aways:
--  Examples of how MEPS and MEPS members collaborated to meet the changing and complicated needs of our local professional community of practice
- An opportunity to experience the MEPS practice of bringing people together for an open conversation with the goals of learning from each other and developing professional skills around current issues and practices.
-    A personal reflection on their own next steps to seek or build community resources for professional learning 
-  A reminder of actionable steps from themselves mailed in 6 months to touch base on their session takeaways and inspire action"""

Participants will share and discuss their experience and ideas that guide their own DIY professional development and support informal local communities of practice, and a personal reflection on their own next steps. 
They will receive their personal reflection in the mail 6 months after this conference."""

Having a network of colleagues outside of our immediate co-workers was crucial when disaster struck. The members of the Museum Educators of Puget Sound have leaned into this community for support, resources, and information during the COVID pandemic. 
Join us for open conversation on what we learned about our identity as museum educators, how we supported each other during different phases of the pandemic, and how to decide what we as Educators can carry forward.
