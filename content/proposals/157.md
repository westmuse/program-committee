session_objectives = """The session aims to accomplish the following objectives:  1) Demonstrate the sense of responsibility that Indigenous museum practitioners feel when they care for their own ancestral belongings. Over the years, we have heard numerous stories from our Indigenous colleagues about their reasons for working within museums. Often, their choice is wrapped up in familial/tribal obligations that make their work more than just a career choice. In this panel, we want to draw out the intense sense of responsibility that Indigenous museum practitioners feel to caring for ancestral belongings in museums. By doing so, we hope that the intended audience will be able to better emphathize with and support Indigenous museum practitioners working within their institutions.  2) Encourage participants to write letters and to develop letter-writing workshops in their home institutions in order to foster healthier institutional work environments. Although our session features Indigenous museum practitioners, letter-writing is something everyone can do. Thus, we will have attendees begin writing their own letter at the end of the workshop. This session models a creative way in which museums can provide exercises for their staff to learn from each other’s experiences to develop cross-cultural empathy and respect.   Two take-aways from the session:  1. A letter that each attendee will begin to write during the session.   2. A handout with more information about the importance of letter writing as a professional development tool."""
session_engagement = """Since we are reading letters, this session engages the audience through performance. Because of the sessions focus on Indigenous museum practitioners and letter-writing, it offers museum folk with a creative way to attend to issues of healing, decolonization, and empathy building. As for resources, pencils and paper would be needed so that attendees can begin writing their own letters."""
session_scalability = """Institutions, large and small, can organize letter-writing workshops with their staff to foster empathy and build community.

Writing a letter to another person is an act of truth-telling. It allows us to confide to those we trust about our hopes, troubles, and current existence. Join us as we share our stories of working within museums through the genre of the letter. We convey why we work in museums, the lessons we want to convey to our ancestors and descendants, and the legacy we wish to leave behind.
