Consider interpretation strategies — Attendees will learn how to approach object interpretation across a variety of perspectives from within and around the museum, considering both traditional and non-traditional voices. Attendees will hear from curatorial and learning experts to inform strategies for developing interpretive materials.
2. Collaborate with colleagues and communities — Attendees will look to their own communities to identify voices and perspectives that might contribute to the appreciation of an object. Attendees will evaluate where valuable perspectives might lie within their communities.
3. Develop and refine technical audio recording skills — Attendees will learn that audio can be easily captured with readily available equipment, with minimal technical expertise required. Attendees will learn to script, capture, and edit audio content using everyday tools."""
session_engagement = """Attendees will consider strategies for developing object-based interpretation by hearing directly from curatorial and learning professionals while viewing objects in the galleries. Participants will learn the technical skills of capturing audio hands on using everyday equipment, including personal devices (e.g. smartphones) as well as provided devices (e.g. handheld field recorders). Participants will create scripts and record audio."""
session_scalability = """The skills learned and developed are easily accessible and transferable across practices, without requiring specialized roles. Attendees will learn how to efficiently harness existing skills and workflows to create avenues toward expanded access to object interpretation.

Interpretation plays a key role in providing context around an object. The communities within and around museums provide opportunities to offer a range of perspectives and interpretations to the visitor: from scholarly to personal; factual to subjective; scripted to spontaneous. Learn how to design, capture, and deliver audio interpretation in this hands-on session at the Nevada Museum of Art.
