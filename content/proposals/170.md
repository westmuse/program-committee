The NEH funds exhibitions, site interpretation, public programs, collections preservation, and capacity building that underlies projects grounded in humanities disciplines, such as history, art history, religious studies, and other fields that critically examine human culture. The session will begin with an overview of the grant opportunities most relevant to museums and address how to navigate the application process, what makes an application competitive, and tips for applying. We will pay special attention to grant programs targeting smaller organizations.
