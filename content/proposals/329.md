Museums are often at the risk of closing, and they do close for numerous reasons. How a community supports its museums and how deep is that engagement, can play a pivotal role in saving museums and also in easing the pain of closure to actually provide benefit. This session discusses the real-life example of the Pasadena Museum of Art closure in 2018 with former employees, and also other museum case studies.
