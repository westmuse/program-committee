In the US, over 140 million people live in communities that could experience damaging earthquakes. This reality poses two challenges for Western Museums. First: How can museums located in earthquake hazard zones protect their staff, visitors, and collections? Second: How can museums support local earthquake resilience, via education, partnerships, advocacy, or other means? For this interdisciplinary and hands-on session, come prepared to discuss ways museums can lead in earthquake preparedness and resilience.
