Collaborative leaders, according to Harvard Business Review,Â regularly seek out a diversity of opinions and ideas among teammates to build strategies and solve problems. As a result, employees are more engaged, feel trusted and are more likely to take ownership of their work. Traditional museum board structures, however, tend to be skeptical of this style of leadership. Explore how a collaborative leadership strategy can create balance in professional and personal ways through the experiences of the Museum of Idaho's leadership team- Executive Director, Jeff Carr and Managing Director, Chloe Doucette.
