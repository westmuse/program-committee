In January of 2024, regulatory changes to Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) went into effect introducing a new definition of "duty of care.” The expanded language mandates that museums must “obtain free, prior, and informed consent from lineal descendants, Indian Tribes, or Native Hawaiian organizations prior to allowing any exhibition of, access to, or research on human remains or cultural items.” Museums have responded by removing collections from display, closing exhibition areas and even entire halls. This panel will invite those knowledgable in the field to discuss the statute, regulatory changes, and implications for the field and museum and indigenous community relations.
