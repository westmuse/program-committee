And it's so hard to prioritize reading for fun when we all have a million things to do every day. This session will highlight the centrality of reading in thoughtful museum practices and encourage people to think outside the box on how it can serve us as professionals. How does poetry inform the work of strategic planners? How can scientific papers make art historians more effective? We'll never know if we don't carve out time to share what we're reading with each other!"""

Reading widely helps us to become well-rounded museum thinkers. It can introduce us to different perspectives, show us creative ways to reframe narratives, and help us decompress after stressful days working for nonprofits. In this session, moderators Nicole Meldahl and Stephanie Brown ask you to bring what you're reading and chat about it with fellow bibliophiles at WMA. Fiction, poetry, history books, technical museum papers: whatever is on your list is on the table as we get to know each other and broaden our reading lists together. And if we're experiencing some conference exhaustion, we can just read silently, together, for part of our time with one another. We write the story for this rejuvenating session.
