**Is that torpedo safe to be on display? Do you have extra requirements in place for storing or displaying firearms? Has anyone ever walked into your lobby with a donation offer, only to pull a grenade out of their pocket? Museums of all types collect and display ordnance (small arms, edged weapons, missiles, grenades, cannons, ammunition and more), join us as we discuss collections safety in collecting objects that were meant to destroy.**
