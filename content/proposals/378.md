Rather than focusing on challenges, what happens when museums view collaborations with Native communities as creative opportunities that can drive innovation? This session will use the in-progress redesign of a permanent exhibition at the High Desert Museum as a case study to illustrate how a collaborative development process with Native communities can transform exhibition strategies. Project partners will demonstrate ways that meaningful dialogue can drive new ideas and how other institutions can embrace this approach.
