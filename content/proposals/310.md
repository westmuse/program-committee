Regardless of museum genre or size, university museums are often comfortable and familiar with managing student employees, but less-familiar with students as volunteers. Some might not even have a structured volunteer program in place to refer to when interested students contact the museum looking for volunteer opportunities. This session will explore ways to utilize university students as volunteers, with the volunteer program implemented by the Museum of Peoples and Cultures as a case study.
