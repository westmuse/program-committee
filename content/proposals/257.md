The potential learning outcomes for participants may include 1) new or increased awareness and understanding of the range and scale of climate action and resilience initiatives taking place in the sector, 2) confidence in appropriateness of the list of climate action items that they create during the session, and 3) confidence in their ability to identify future opportunities for engaging in this work."""
session_engagement = """Participants will spend approximately 1/3 of the session listening to the presenters and viewing a slideshow. The rest of the session will, through several activities, invite participants to discuss in small groups and with the whole group, climate action, resiliency, and leadership in their own lives and organization. Participants will be guided in constructing their own list of realistic climate action items with the help of the presenters and their colleagues."""
session_scalability = """**Climate change is affecting all our communities and all our organizations, yet its impacts are distinct by region and by museum type. That complexity does not mean that climate action and resiliency must be complicated! The actions we can take, and specifically those that participants will choose for themselves (described previously), can be simple or complex, and adapted to the size of the building and staff, and the building location. This session is designed to encourage confident next steps to identifying opportunities to shift from business as usual to climate smart business.**

**Museums are uniquely positioned to foster collective action and effect change on one of the greatest challenges facing humans today, climate change. Whether you serve five thousand or five million visitors annually, every cultural organization can and must lead this work. Come learn how the sector is doing this, and how you can do this at your organization too. You will leave this session with realistic action items to help you get started.**
