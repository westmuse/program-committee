session_objectives = """During this workshop, attendees will grow their understanding of the application and benefits of inquiry-based learning in multiple disciplines, develop the skills and confidence to address sensitive and challenging subject matter, strengthen their organization's learning programs and advance their mission. When interpreting certain pieces in a museum's collection, questions may come up about the ethical context of the acquisition, preparation, or intention behind the object. Questions are asked and ideas come up that involve mortality, spirituality, tragedy, morality---challenging topics which many educators may not feel properly equipped to address. Through interaction with mindful, inclusive, and equitable learning theories and frameworks, educators will gain the skills and confidence to turn these questions and ideas into conversations that propel emotional intelligence and encourage positive action. 

This workshop is built on a foundation of social and cultural sensitivity, respect for all abilities and backgrounds, and honors multiple ways of knowing and being."""
session_engagement = """Attendees will work in large and small groups on a number of activities where we will practice Visual Thinking Strategies with a number of artworks and artifacts.

As educators and interpreters, we are often faced with a number of Hard Questions about challenging and sensitive subjects. In this workshop, we will exercise Visual Learning Strategies with artworks as well as authentic biofacts, and explore how to address sensitive topics with diverse audiences. Inquiry-based learning promotes institutions' missions by advancing interpersonal connection and intersectional empathy.
