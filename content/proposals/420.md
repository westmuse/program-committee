session_unique = """This workshop can help any expert in any field understand the museum building process and work with their team/staff to make a successful museum project through a rich framework of best practices."""
session_objectives = """1. Attendees will learn about the various studies and due-diligence that are appropriate to precede design as how to solicit, evaluate, and engage a design and technical team with roles and responsibilities for all phases of a museum project (renovation or new-build).
2. Attendees will learn how to develop and right-size a museum architectural program that is comprehensive, achievable, and sustainable, how to anticipate and manage cost issues, and receive best practices in the procurement of outside consultant support from early planning through construction and implementation.
3. Attendees will learn how to plan museum focused capital projects such as coordinating collections-based solutions, work through new hybrid staffing models to revamp back of house spaces, environmental and systems projects, and the interplay between exhibits/interpretation and architecture to provide a holistic vision and visitor experience."""
session_engagement = """In addition to the PowerPoint presentation, attendees will be provided with workbooks for notetaking, there will be multiple discussion break out group sections as well as productive learning activities that will occur throughout the workshop. All activity materials will be provided by the presenters."""
session_scalability = """  **Imagine you are a museum director or curator AND you are also the world’s leading expert in the field of paleontology, or math, or art. Now, imagine that you have the incredible opportunity of being tasked with a major museum building project. You are smart, capable - but you have never done this before, and you don’t know where to start! **
**Here, at SmithGroup, we are incredibly fortunate that our Cultural Practice gets to work with all sorts of experts on projects all the time. Our museum clients and potential clients may be experts in their respective fields, but chances are, they have never done a museum project before. That’s because major museum projects only come along every 25-40 years – once in a lifetime. Since we maintain a studio that is devoted to cultural work, we have extensive experience.**
**We realized that these experts may need help, basic education, a tool kit – and may not even know who to ask, or where to find assistance. So, we began this to help foster a greater understanding of the entire process.  **
**This “Everything-Everywhere-All at Once” or “how to make a museum class”, has been presented in other formats at AAM, MAAM, and other venues. We can scale it and tailor it for individual institution needs, offering full day, half day, or hour-long conversations. The learning points themselves are scalable and whether a small house museum, a renovation project, major gallery renovation, or new ground up building, we provide a framework that will guide attendees through this robust, once in a lifetime type of project. **
**The workshop walks participants step by step through an idealized museum project – from planning, to design, to installation, construction, and beyond opening day. The Collective presents topics that may be pitfalls to projects, and provides questions, examples, and plenty of time for conversation and discussion. **
