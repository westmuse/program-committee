- How the “great resignation,” the drive toward unionization, and the critiques launched by movements such as “Change the Museum” and “Museum Workers Speak” have served as a serious wake-up call for museums everywhere. Attendees will learn about the long overdue turn toward human-centered turn in the museum field, along with how human-centered HR practices can help museums build more equitable and sustainable workplace cultures. 

- Attendees will unpack what human-centered HR is, the benefits that result from taking such an approach to organizational culture, and concrete examples of what human-centered HR can look like in practice. In addition, attendees will be invited to share the human-centered shifts that have been taking place (or that they wish would take place) in their own organizations. 

- Drawing from a Human-Centered HR Repository developed by the Museum of Us (and currently in a beta-testing phase), attendees also will learn how such a Repository might better serve them as well as other museum professionals in their efforts to become more human-centered. 

The goal? To uplift us all!"""
session_engagement = """This workshop will be largely designed around audience engagement. Specifically, attendees will divide into break-out groups where they will have the opportunity to share human-centered HR practice shifts (or ones that they hope to see) in their own organizations. Then, attendees will share out such practices with the rest of the attendees. Attendees will identify common themes, obstacles, and solutions in the development and incorporation of human-centered HR practice shifts throughout the museum field."""
