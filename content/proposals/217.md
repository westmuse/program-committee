In 2022, the Ute Indian Museum built a natural playground to provide a space for children to learn and play. The NatureScape is a Scandinavian concept with a goal to reconnect children to nature and creative play. The museum has combined that ideal with the Native American belief of working with and respecting Mother Nature. This presentation will share project information so this concept can be replicated at other museums.
