session_objectives = """HOW DO I GET STARTED? Capital projects—big or small—are often unknown territory for museum leaders. This workshop is designed to help participants avoid squandering time, funding and goodwill by imparting our museum experts' decades of experience in the planning and design of museum building projects. Participants will learn the various assessments, plans, studies and due diligence that should precede any design, and how to identify where they should begin their own planning process given their organization’s unique requirements—even how to develop the compelling business proposal that secures the donation to enable a future building project. 
 
WHO DO I NEED TO HIRE? Participants will learn the rules of thumb for creating a highly effective capital project team. We will cover best practices for the roles needed inside an organization to be an effective collaborator and client to your design and construction team. Participants will also learn the types of design and construction partners they may need to hire depending on their project’s requirements and how to effectively solicit for these partners. Further, the panel will discuss how to set expectations for collaboration and coordination within the greater capital project team (inside and outside your museum). 
 
HOW CAN I AVOID MONEY PROBLEMS? Participants will learn how to approach developing a budget for a capital project, including typical costs, and looking to the future to anticipate operational costs. Further, participants will learn how to anticipate and manage cost issues that typically arise during the life of a capital project."""
session_engagement = """Assuming advanced registration, we would like the opportunity to allow participants to confidentially submit their most burning questions about planning and managing capital projects to our presentation team in advance. We will then be able to tailor the content to ensure we’re speaking to what participants need from the workshop. In a half-day workshop, we are also able to incorporate a hands-on activity allowing participants to connect and discuss challenges in smaller break-out groups."""
session_scalability = """Organization type, size, funding and even maturity will not affect the learning outcomes of the workshop. We will address universal best practices in a range of scenarios that will be applicable to all participants.

Join this crash course in successfully planning capital projects, of all sizes, led by a panel of multi-disciplinary museum planning, design, and construction experts.
