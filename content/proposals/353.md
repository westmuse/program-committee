session_objectives = """The main takeaway for this session is a brainstorming technique that museum professionals can take back to their institutions to ensure broader participation. Often, the loudest person is heard in a traditional brainstorming session. The 10 x 10 levels the playing field, allowing broader participation. You no longer have to be extroverted to have a voice.

The second takeaway is for museum professionals to shift their thinking and approach to challenges by turning them into “How Might We” questions. It takes something that may be negative and creates a more solution-oriented mindset. Rather than focusing on how burned out we are feeling, we might ask, “How might we build capacity for ourselves?” or “How might we balance our passion for museum work with our capacity?” 

The third takeaway is creating a space for dialogue on the theme of the conference: BALANCE. The 10 x 10 will allow participants to consider how to harmonize organizational health and staff wellbeing. Rather than a presenter telling attendees how to achieve a work-life balance, a facilitator will engage everyone in generating solutions."""
session_engagement = """The 10 x 10 approach engages the idea of “Together Alone.” We work together to create solutions, but working individually. After ideas are generated for five minutes, they are then posted on a wall. Each audience member receives small stickers to cast their votes on the solutions to prioritize or pursue. The ideas with the most votes move to the top. This allows us to come up with 3-5 solutions in a matter of minutes!"""
session_scalability = """The tools learned in this session will be very scalable. From small to large organizations, or small challenges to big problems, these techniques are inclusive and engaging. They can be used with boards, staff, etc.

**This session will introduce a brainstorming approach that is inclusive and collaborative. It’s called 10 x 10. It’s a fast and easy approach to brainstorming as a group. After an overview of the 10 x 10, we’ll take the conference theme to brainstorm as a group. Examples include: How might we build capacity for ourselves? How might we build capacity for our institutions? How might we balance our passion for museum work with our capacity?**
