For many indigenous communities, darkness is a time of creative genesis and regeneration, a time for hope beyond the fear.  From fiscal constraints to grants that have disappeared to federal staff that are no longer in positions of leadership and support, the impacts and despair is real and reaches across our museum field.  In these troubling times, we will hear from multiple museum practitioners who will share their programs, exhibitions, practices and beliefs that will help attendees keep the fire alive, stirring our passions and purposes.
