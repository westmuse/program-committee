The second intended learning outcome is that participants will gain an understanding of the importance of nature in attaining balance for themselves, their visitors, and staff.

The third intended learning outcome is that participants will gain helpful tools and strategies for outdoor exploration that they can apply at their own institutions. Specifically, they will engage in close observation and inquiry activities we’ve used successfully for decades to help our teams and visitors gain the comfort and awareness in nature that leads to better stewardship."""

An important part of finding balance is taking opportunities to, as the saying goes, slow down and smell the roses. Let’s explore the hotel’s nature trails with activities designed to get us up close with the wonders of nature. 
Close observation and nature play are fundamental aspects of human development, and using the outdoors as context for learning is a powerful way to engage visitors and staff in the regenerative nature of nature.
