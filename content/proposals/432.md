Elevating Your Mindset in Collections will dive into the benefits of maintaining collections for the public as well as ourselves. Collections staff work hard and are passionate, but many times behind the scenes work is overlooked and under appreciated (even unintentionally so). The Registrars Committee Western Region wants to bring some joy back into the work we do and celebrate our wins, big and small.
