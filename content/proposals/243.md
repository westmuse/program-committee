session_objectives = """Decolonization/decolonizing initiatives is often a vague and intimidating term, so much so that many museums who wish to embark on this journey feel stuck. Instead of a top-down presentation format, the Burke Museum and the Museum of Us will model a decolonized conversation, sharing what has worked for our museums in hopes to inspire a different approach to decolonization/decolonizing initiatives and DEAI work.  

The Burke’s Tribal Liaison and the Museum of Us CEO will interview decolonization/decolonizing initiatives specialists at the partner’s museum, leading session attendees in a discussion of the practical applications of their decolonization/decolonizing initiatives work. Session attendees will learn:

1. What decolonization/decolonizing initiatives looks like in practice at the Washington State Museum of Natural History and Culture and the Museum of Us, and
2. The interrelatedness of key concepts like consultation, representation, the meaning of ownership, the impact of colonization, the purpose of collections, and an institution’s responsibility to community needs and knowledge.

Participants will leave inspired to start or continue their own decolonization/decolonizing initiatives journey, with the tools needed to begin identifying areas in their own institutions where concrete, action-oriented conversations can take place, and with some of the language that will help those conversations take shape. They will also learn the importance of preserving and sharing data about this work, in order to use that collective wisdom to inform creative, innovative, collaborative steps towards a more equitable, inclusive museum."""
session_engagement = """Audience members will see some of the practical areas that the Burke Museum and the Museum of Us have found success in, and in small groups, will discuss creative ways they can either apply some of the strategies to their museums, or ways in which they can creatively decolonize too. There will also be an opportunity to ask questions of the presenters at the end."""
session_scalability = """The Burke Museum is a larger museum associated with a university, while the Museum of Us is a smaller, independent museum. They both focus on creative approaches to decolonization/decolonizing initiatives that can be adapted, modified, or learned from to suit any type of organization.

other_comments = """This work cross-cuts the museum and is relevant to professionals at all levels, from all departments: leadership, curatorial, administrative, education etc. It can even be applied to non-museum organizations as well."""
theme_relationship = """The process of decolonization/decolonizing initiatives is not simply one of reckoning with the past, but in transmuting the past into a better future. Both the Burke Museum and the Museum of Us are actively looking for new, creative ways to improve the museums and move into a new future of museums."""
theme_comments = """This session will be a dual-interview format, with one person from the Burke Museum interviewing someone from the Museum of Us, and vice versa for a total of four presenters. There will also be an opportunity for members of the audience to engage in similar ways with other audience members, and ask questions of the presenters. 

The concept here is to model what a decolonized transfer of information looks like, where the information is applicable and helpful to the participants as well.

Discussions about decolonization/decolonizing initiatives often rely on abstract, academic language that fails to connect with real world practices. 

In this session, Burke Museum and Museum of Us staff members will model a decolonized conversation, transparently sharing their experiences in a way that can be applied to many museums.

Join us for a robust conversation about how our values impact the way we work, and how we navigate change in ways that build community rather than foster conflict.
