These outcomes will help build bridges across departments that frequently compete for resources and recognition; increase access to the 90-95% of objects held in museum storage; and aims to raise the standards of best practices for collaboration across museum departments."""

The California Collections Resource Center at the Oakland Museum of California (OMCA) houses the largest collection of California-focused art and artifacts in the state. We'll share the steps of recent internal partnership-based projects that have increased access to art, history, and natural science collections items for a wide range of people, including OMCA staff, researchers, Native American tribes, other institutions, and the general public.
