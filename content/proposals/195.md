Panelists intend to discuss culture changes and progressive mindsets in their museums that led up to these collaborations.  Participants will assess how "ready" they might be to do this kind of work and their museum's strengths and weaknesses.
2. In this case, collaborators are museum educators who have the support of administration but it is a personal journey as well.  Panelists will discuss personal growth and participants will undertake a thoughtful self-evaluation.
3. Collaborations are definitely challenging--panelists will demonstrate the skills and recognize the benefits of working collaboratively especially with regard to issues of significance to Native communities.  Participants will develop an awareness and responsibility towards a shared humanity and issues of significance to the Native community."""

It's easy to get bogged down in land acknowledgements and decolonization discussions.  For some, these are unnecessary hurdles preventing amazing collaborations!  Mingei International Museum, The New Children's Museum, and Barona Cultural Center & Museum moved forward creating amazing collaborations benefitting all.  Collaborations with Native communities include difficult discussions, educational journeys, lots of listening, and lots of coffee, but end up in success.  Pick up some ideas from us to implement at home.
