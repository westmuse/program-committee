session_objectives = """By the end of this session, participants will be able to:
1.   Think about creative solutions to issues such as what the museum industry can do should the IMLS disappear. 
2. Forge Inclusive Partnerships: Create actionable plans for collaborating with underrepresented communities, building long-term, trust-based relationships that enrich programming and institutional resilience.
3. Navigate Political Pushback: Develop tools and advocacy techniques to address political threats—such as Trump’s proposal to terminate IMLS—and ensure continued support for museums.
4.   Amplify Marginalized Voices: Identify effective strategies for incorporating the narratives of LGBTQ+ and BIPOC communities into exhibitions, programs, and collections.
5. Transform Museum Spaces: Craft initiatives that convert museums into safe havens for dialogue and healing, fostering a climate of inclusivity and proactive social engagement."""
session_engagement = """This session engages participants through interactive group work, scenario role-plays, and roundtable discussions. We’ll start with an open discussion on the current museum ecosystem, then break into subject-specific groups addressing topics such as centering intersectional histories, building community partnerships, designing engaging exhibitions, decolonizing archives, creating safe spaces, and navigating political pushback. Participants will collaboratively craft advocacy plans and digital strategies, leaving with tangible, actionable tools to implement in their institutions."""
session_scalability = """  The strategies and toolkits developed during this session are adaptable across diverse museum settings—from small community institutions to large metropolitan museums—ensuring that the outcomes can be implemented on various scales to enhance equity, advocacy, and inclusive programming.
