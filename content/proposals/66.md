Recent events regarding salary transparency (such as the Google Spreadsheet: Art/Museum Salary Transparency 2019) have sparked conversations in the museum world about gender equity and the pay gap. This session looks at differences in compensation and expectations across the field, and addresses equitable pay from a gender-expansive perspective, considering the impact of the pay gap on transgender, non-binary, and gender-non-conforming staff.
