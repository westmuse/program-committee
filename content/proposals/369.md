1) Present information on collaborative fundraising and proposal-writing in a relatable, engaging way. The audience will leave with new ideas for listening to their colleagues and conducting research for better communication. 
2) Present a balanced perspective between highly technical and detailed Collections and Exhibitions projects and the mission-oriented goals and measurable impacts that funding agencies look for when they review proposals. The audience will gain an understanding of the differences between these two perspectives and how to bridge them. 
3) Provide writing instruction/practice exercises that help translate internal workflows, tasks, and budget line items into visitor benefits, community impact, and meaningful purpose. Audience members will understand how to work with their colleagues to create fundraising proposals that also bring greater intention and purpose to getting their work funded."""

**The overall focus of this session is to demonstrate how collections staff and development staff can develop a true fundraising partnership. This session will help fundraisers better understand how to work closely with collections staff members to craft successful funding proposals. It will also help collections staff members communicate the community impact and visitor benefit of highly technical (and expensive) collections projects.**
