session_objectives = """During this session, we will explore different aspects of sustainability across various scales including building design, operations, and exhibition design.  Collectively, this session will benefit audience members of all knowledge levels on sustainability.

We strongly believe that topics such as these should be included more consistently in WMA programming, as environment and climate issues ultimately impact all aspects of the museum field.

1.     New construction provides an incredible opportunity to build for a more positive future.  We will use a case study in progress at the High Desert Museum to explore the decision making process for a new facility that is striving to connect its design to the mission and values of the Museum.
2.     At the scale of exhibitions, participants will learn about new guidelines for how to make their permanent and temporary exhibits more environmentally friendly while minimizing waste.  Different strategies will be discussed including energy efficiency, healthy materials, and designing for disassembly and reuse/recycling of materials.  While an individual exhibit may not seem like it has a global impact, when you consider the thousands of new exhibits around the world each year, small changes can make an incredible difference if we can work together to shift the industry."""
