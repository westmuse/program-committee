1- Understand the historic, cyclical nature of ideological upheaval and effective responses that can inform our forward-learning practices and navigational strategies.

2-Understand the why’s and how’s of driving toward the distant horizon goals while managing the immediate bumps in the road.

3- Leave with an exploratory discussion protocol to facilitate conversations in their own organizations, along with ideas for how to anticipate and elevate their own planning and responses to changing times."""

Wrap up with a full-group discussion of optionally anonymous, issue-specific examples presented by the small groups."""

**Join us for honest conversations about making progress while navigating cyclical changes of political ideologies and the manipulation of language often associated with them. Learn about historical examples of adaptation from our field and how lessons learned then can guide us now. Colleagues will share lived experiences and invite you to share yours in small groups focused on helping you find your own answers, while building empathy for differing perspectives as strategies to stay the course.**
