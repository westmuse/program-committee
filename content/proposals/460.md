The highest calling of museums and cultural institutions is to serve as laboratories of learning. Museums that move beyond simply serving as adjuncts to formal education, will be more useful to their communities and more resilient in meeting the funding challenges of the future. Part philosophy and part playbook, this session will use the California State Railroad Museum as a case-study in turning a museum into a classroom where students K-Graduate learn by doing.
