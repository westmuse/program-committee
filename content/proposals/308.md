session_objectives = """(1) The attendees will learn one method of collaborative curatorial approach to an exhibition featuring a performing art form. These collaborators worked together to transform the story of the development of a performance form to be shared through a gallery exhibition experience. What are strategies to transform a dynamic performance form to a static gallery space?

(2) This exhibition was first developed, designed, and displayed at the East-West Center with the intention that it would travel to other venues after closing at EWC, initially to other venues on O‘ahu, then to neighbor islands in Hawai‘i and potentially beyond. With our first endeavor to display this exhibition at another venue, it became clear that it was necessary to adapt the project. How does the curatorial team adapt an exhibition for another venue in alignment with host venue’s vision & mission, physical space constraints, and audience?

(3) In developing this exhibition we recognized that we would have a diverse audience that had varying degrees of familiarity with Hawaiian Theatre, from practitioners to those who had perhaps seen a performance to those who this would be their first introduction to the form. What are strategies to create a “layered” storytelling experience in the exhibition development so that the exhibition can be appreciated by diverse audiences?"""
