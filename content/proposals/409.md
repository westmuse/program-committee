How can small museums in the West connect to the semiquincentennial in 2026? Sometimes the topic feels elusive for organizations in our younger states, and observing huge anniversaries can be fraught. Using AASLH's Program Guide for small organizations, we will discuss different ways to utilize existing programs and ways to implement accessible ideas for observing the 250th. For those who don't feel connected to the themes of the 250th, we will discuss how our western states can adopt larger concepts of civics and place to make sense of the semi-Q.
