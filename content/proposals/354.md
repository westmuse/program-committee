By creating confidential supportive spaces with skilled professionals we provide teachers new and creative tools to heal and help them in their classrooms. The teachers have told us that this type of programming has been more effective for them to understand the importance of EQ in a relevant way that can then pass on to others. 

This also allowed them feel communal about their experience. Others are feeling the same way and were able to offer support and counsel as part of the program. 
Facilitators have confirmed participation on the panel to share how their area of expertise works and can be used for other types of healing programs."""

This is useful for any organization creating spaces for dealing with shared struggle. Each facilitator will explain how and why their process is used for healing and offer references for further exploration. We will share the survey responses, and letters from participants. And answer any Q&A as to how we made space and how these methods can be used at other sites. We are also willing to provide a follow-up workshop on these processes: Talking Circles, Horticultural Therapy, Emotions Work.

This partnership with Riverside Office of Education shed light on teachers in our county who are struggling at levels that go unnoticed. By creating a safe space for them when we closed to public, to share, process, and support each other we are working to build resiliency in those that care for our children. Using indigenous talking circles, horticultural therapy, art, and emotions therapy we help our teachers build tools for them, and their students.Â
