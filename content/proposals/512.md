A museum’s brand promise represents what guests can expect from products, services and overall actions.  Three panelists illustrate different examples of branding. Nevada Museum of Art presents _mixed branding strategy_ by using examples of merchandise that highlights artists and exhibitions.  San Diego Natural History Museum discusses how voice contributes to _attitude branding_. Finally, SFMOMA’s Open Space project from 2008-2020 explores _brand extension.   _
