Museums & cultural institutions are often quick to celebrate the progress they have made toward racial equity, while struggling to dedicate time to pause and reflect on what might prevent them from moving forward. Museums & Race offers this session to help museum practitioners foster new dialogic skills to have more truthful conversations, as well as practical ways to move from naming the issues to developing practical strategies to combat harmful behaviors.
