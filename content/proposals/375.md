We will also share information about our museums, audiences, and locations to give context on why debuting this programming was challenging.
Through these case studies, participants will gain new ideas and strategies around:
- Advocating for your progressive programming to leadership, sponsors, donors, and state/provincial government, especially in complicated social and political climates. 
- Forging ongoing, reciprocal relationships and elevating the voices of small community organizations and local artists - looking beyond big Pride Centers.
- Planning programming that balances being mission-driven, socially relevant, collaborative, and fun!"""

Has your museum hosted a drag show? Would you encounter a lot of pushback if you tried? 
Hear from two different museums of very different sizes, geographic locations, and audiences on how they launched new Pride programming while navigating the barriers of complex political landscapes in Utah and in rural British Columbia. 
Using these case studies, presenters will focus on tips for creating and advocating for inclusive, collaborative, and impactful 2SLGBTQ+ programs.
