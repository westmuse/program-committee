As we continue to experience anxiety and burnout as aftereffects of the last few years, it has become increasingly important to incorporate these types of programs and frameworks into art museums to support each other and museum communities. Presenters will discuss relevant research and projects centered on work/school- life balance and care in museum spaces and how their work addresses these topics.
Participants will:
- Gain an understanding of care theory and how it relates to community building and belonging in and with academic museums
- Learn current strategies for incorporating care into a variety of projects
- Rethink the role of museums in museum professional education and visitor engagement through the lens of care."""

How might care theory and praxis cultivate a sense of belonging between university students and museums? What does care theory and praxis look like currently in university art museums? This session will explore how one art museum became a site for cultivating care and belonging through two different approaches to audience engagement. Participants are invited to reflect on the role of museums and museum education while practicing acts of care.
