How does a museum change when we invite communities to have a voice in our work? Our session will explore this question through stories of transformative museum-community partnerships. Each story will be told collaboratively by two people who know it well: one a museum professional and the other a community leader. The stories will focus on the firsthand experience of working together to impact exhibitions, programs, collections, and processes in profound, and often unexpected, ways.
