Collaboration can be sticky. Lots of ideas, feedback, and opinions contribute to making exhibitions great, but can also be challenging to manage. We’ll be sharing nuts and bolts tools for delivering and asking for feedback, decision-making and feasibility, and improving transparent accountability. In this session, we will also ask participants to share areas of collaborative work they find challenging and begin to match that with other participants who might have tools and solutions to share.
