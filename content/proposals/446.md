This highly interactive session builds upon a national effort to start up an Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Museums and Museum Professionals Association. Through live-polling, large-group discussions, and small-group breakouts, participants will have the opportunity to share their current experiences and needs. Participants will also help contribute ideas, hopes, and recommendations to help inform the development of the association. This session is open to all WMA conference attendees.
