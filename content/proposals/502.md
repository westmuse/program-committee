**How do you test titles and messaging angles to ensure an exhibition/program name speaks to the intended audience, accurately reflects the content, and motivates visitation? This session will feature three perspectives on formative testing: Evaluator, Director of Visitor Insights, and Director of Marketing. Each speaker will describe their organizations’ testing process, including the role of internal and external stakeholders. Attendees will learn practical tips and get inspired to try out these testing strategies.**
