session_objectives = """Learning Objectives:
1)      Gain a greater understanding and appreciation of artifact conservation lighting in museums which includes deeply informative two case studies.
2)      Learn key critical components that go into the development of a lighting design.
3)      Learn about luminaire/light source options and control system considerations (pros and cons of different choices)
 
There are several key “chapters” to this presentation:
1)      Introduction by the Lighting Manager of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. A discussion of why conservation lighting need not be boring lighting. Personal reflections on the day-to-day demands of maintaining systems. A brief tour/case study of the new museum.
2)      An gentle-touch introduction to lighting design considerations—aesthetic and technical (i.e., color temperature, color rendering rating system, contrast, revealing form, etc.)
3)      A deeper dive into case lighting including choosing LED vs. Fiber Optic, mounting details, etc.
4)      Transition into a hardware demonstration where attendees are able to see and manipulate equipment in their own hands.
5)      An over overview of lighting design specifically systems addressing conservation issues.
6)      A case study in using the conservation metric of exposure over time. George Washington’s Tent multimedia presentation at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia.
7)      Question and answer period"""

Should you use LEDs or Fiber Optic Lighting for artifact lighting? Should we spot measure or calculate exposure over time? We will explore a variety of lighting techniques including light sources, occupancy sensors, and lighting control systems. We will also present two case studies detailing lighting conservation issues for the new Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles and George Washington's Tent at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia.
