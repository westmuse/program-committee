session_objectives = """1) Explore methods of qualitative data collection in the museum field
Presenters will share the process of data collection in three categories: visitor interviews, post-visit survey responses, and talk-back exhibit responses. We will discuss what has and hasn’t worked for us, and give suggestions for success. We will also invite participants to share their own experiences, successes, and challenges involving qualitative data collection. We will give particular attention to topics such as mitigating bias by maintaining evaluator neutrality, protecting interviewee anonymity and tips for eliciting complete, relevant information from the interviewee.
2) Develop methods for data coding, analysis, and reporting
If participants chose to bring qualitative data from their own institution (including but not limited to visitor interviews, post-visit survey responses, talk-back exhibit responses, and comment cards), we will work to develop an analysis protocol based on the nature of the data, goals of the project, the mission of their institution, and resources available to the project. For participants without data from their own institutions, we will provide example data and collaborate to create a coding analysis protocol based on particular goals expressed by participants.. 
3) Consider outcomes of successful research projects
Presenters will share examples of how other departments at OMCA have utilized findings of visitor research projects, and discuss the value of visitor insight even outside of motivating particular decisions."""
session_engagement = """Participants will engage in step-by-step qualitative research activities: hands-on data coding, small-group discussions, and guided exercises using their qualitative visitor data or provided samples. Facilitators will provide coding frameworks, analysis techniques, and real-time feedback, while also guiding participants through strategies for working collaboratively with various stakeholders to align findings with institutional goals. Attendees will leave with a qualitative research toolkit, hands-on experience, and concrete strategies for making visitor data an integral part of museum decision-making."""
session_scalability = """Our workshop is designed to be adaptable for museums of all sizes and disciplines, from small institutions with limited resources to large museums with multiple galleries and departments. At the Oakland Museum of California, we conduct visitor research across art, history, natural sciences, and special exhibitions—demonstrating how qualitative insights can be applied across a variety of museum contexts. Participants will engage in hands-on exercises tailored to different institutional needs, learning how to scale qualitative research methods from low-tech, small-team approaches to more structured, department-wide initiatives. 20-25 attendees max.

In this workshop, learn how to use qualitative visitor data to gain insights into your institution’s visitor base, including voices and experiences that are often overlooked. Bring in visitor comments, talk-back exhibit responses, or other qualitative data from your institution, or work with example data to learn how to collect, code, analyze, and report information about visitors’ museum experiences.  A range of analysis techniques for all staff levels will be demonstrated.
