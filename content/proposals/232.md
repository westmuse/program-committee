session_objectives = """Outcomes include sharing experiences, recommendations and best practices for: (1) collaborative planning and grant writing; (2) creating positive team dynamics for a complex project; (3) designing and tending to an array of institutional, community, and museum collaborations; (4) developing and managing a diverse cohort of 20 early to mid-career museum professionals, artists and practitioners from 13 island communities; (5) including Western notions of “best practices” alongside discussions on indigenization and decolonization; and most importantly (6) learning about indigenous notions of care in the Pacific. A roundtable/fishbowl approach involving six people embodies the ethos of the project and will enable active discussion around these learning objectives from multiple perspectives, including one of the cohort members, while also fielding questions from the audience."""
session_engagement = """This will not be a series of talking heads. After opening with an informative presentation on the project (which includes video footage), we will enter into an engaging dialogue among a group of six people who were actively involved in the institute. In keeping with the nature of the institute, there will be the sharing of indigenous songs and stories. Audience members will be encouraged to actively participate in the discussion."""

They seek to connect their collections to the communities from which they originated, and to honor indigenous notions of care. Our 20 cohort members come from museums and institutions that are large and small and we learned from each other how to create a Net(work) of Care in support of both our respective collections and each other as individuals and institutions.  The lessons we learned and wish to share thus will apply to a multitude of organizations.

Relationships between and among individuals and institutions are critical in order to enable our field to remain inspired and engaged, so that we can serve our communities and their collections."""
theme_comments = """More on session format: We are envisioning a roundtable or fishbowl-type approach. We will begin with an overall presentation of the _Weaving a Net(work) of Care for Oceanic Collections_ project, which will involve various speakers and will include video footage and photographs (15 minutes). We will then engage in a group discussion with six people who were involved in the project, from UH Manoa and East-West Center, as well as a graduate student in museum studies and a member of the cohort. Central questions will be: (1) how was this project envisioned and did it live up to everyone's expectations; (2) what were the benefits and challenges of such a complex multi-faceted project?; (3) how were Indigenous Pacific notions of care addressed and supported? and (4) what does the future hold?  At each juncture, we will open up the conversation for audience questions, ensuring an open and engaging session.

This session explores _Weaving a Net(work) of Carefor Oceanic Collections: A Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Museum Institute_.  Participants will discuss the challenges, joys and outcomes of training a cohort of 20 early-to-mid career professionals from 13 island communities, all while navigating COVID. The project, which focused on professional development and indigenous approaches to collections, exhibitions, and conservation, began with virtual programming across 7 time zones and culminated in a 4 week in-person institute.
