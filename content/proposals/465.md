Succession planning is one of those essential things that all organizations need to do and often do not prioritize.  In this session, experienced museum professionals will create a space to discuss succession planning at every level: what it is, why it matters, and how to do it, including resources for weaving it into organizational culture and practice.  Attendees will be actively involved in the conversation, exploring their role and sharing stories from their own experiences.
