**Do you ever find yourself having to lead people who don't directly report to you? **
**Us too.**
**Join this group of museum professionals to engage in conversation about managing and leading in multiple directions with professionalism, humor, and grace. The session will start with a discussion between the panelists, and then move into small group conversations with all participants. It will conclude by reconvening and sharing what we heard, offering best practices for all.**
