This active writing workshop will give participants a space to write using professional writing techniques. This guided workshop will provide participants writing tools to bring back to their office. The focus will be on persuasive grant-writing using a clear and succinct project goal, objectives, and evaluation plan. We will give and receive constructive feedback. Participants can bring a work in progress or a previous grant application to work on in the workshop.
