Today more than ever, museums must lead efforts to confront hate, oppression and discrimination. Our organizations have the potential to be public centers, through exhibitions, public programs and educational offerings, that offer models for deterring hate and promoting diversity, understanding, and respect. Panelists will consider new insights and approaches for facing the immediate future.
