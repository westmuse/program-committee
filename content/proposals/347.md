Gathering guest feedback is a critical step in making data-driven decisions – but it can seem overwhelming. This workshop offers a practical approach to doing this important work, with no special tools necessary.
This hands-on session includes all the steps in the process of creating and administering surveys, from crafting great questions to analyzing data. Participants emerge with their own survey matrix underway, samples of winning questions, and resources for continuing the work at home.
