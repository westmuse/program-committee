session_objectives = """In 2019, the Burke Museum turned itself Inside/Out, establishing new levels of openness in all aspects of museum practice. This session will focus on one key aspect of this model, a deeper engagement with cultural stakeholders, acknowledging and addressing the issues in our museum’s colonial history and fully committing to creating opportunities and access for diverse communities.

Session attendees will hear from the Burke’s Tribal Liaison (TL), former Executive Director, and members of the Native American Advisory Board (NAAB), and will learn:

- How community voices—primarily via the NAAB—led to the creation of the TL role and defined its place within our organizational structure; 
- What decolonization looks like at the Burke, and how it affects not only cultural practices but also scientific research; and 
- What new initiatives the TL has put into place—including a yearlong Assessment and Healing Plan—and how this work has served to support the Burke’s mission to “care for and share natural and cultural collections so all people can learn, be inspired, generate knowledge, feel joy, and heal.”

Attendees will leave this session with a better understanding of how consultation with community advisory boards is essential to decolonization. At the Burke, our TL and NAAB collaborate with staff members in the development, communications, exhibits and visitors experience departments, as well as with our fundraising board and volunteers. These wide-ranging interactions deepen cohesion and collegiality within and among museum departments and stakeholder groups."""
session_engagement = """The panel will engage the audience through storytelling and/or a story circle and an interactive format that provides time for reflection. Depending on the size of the audience, we will invoke a cultural practice that promotes engagement by strongly encouraging all participants to speak, even if only to verbally acknowledge their presence in the conversation and in the physical space."""
session_scalability = """The Burke’s approach to decolonization, which embeds Indigenous voices early on in museum decision-making of all types, is of value to those organizations that serve Indigenous communities through collections, programming, education, and other museum activities. By focusing on the process by which we came to turn our intentions into actions, we hope to provide a model that other institutions--regardless of size--can adapt and use to best meet the needs of their own internal and external constituencies.

Decolonization heals. Decolonization reconnects people to the natural environment. Decolonization finds common ground. 

At the Burke Museum, we are embedding Indigenous voices in all aspects of museum practice in ways that promote decolonization and contribute to meaningful systemic change.

Join us for a conversation about how we are creating an institutional culture that values and reflects the input of a broader range of voices and thus meets the needs of a broader range of audiences.
