Objective 2 – Learning the players – Attendees will learn about the roles of various consultants that are engaged for these studies, and how their scope can be defined, and how there is a balance between all of these players – how they work together. 
 
Objective 3 – The RFP – Using pre-built building blocks, attendees will be asked to work in small groups and put together the type or types of study is being requested, and which roles will be critical to the success of that study. While not a working or official RFP, attendees will understand how role applies to the scope, and gain a more thorough understanding of the “how”, to bring to their organizations."""

**What’s in a study? What does it take? Come chat with experts in museum management, financial, and facility/exhibit planning to learn about the types of studies, and how to balance the players involved, the scopes, and the needs of an institution in the moment. Attendees will explore developing an outline style RFP with your colleagues in a small-group activity. **
