Increase connections between communities and institutions: Attendees will build an understanding of community-based curation as one strategy for increasing participation and cultivating relationships. 
Develop long-term community relationships and networks: Attendees will identify approaches to become more responsive and reflective of audience / community needs and interests. 
Develop new interpretations of the western region: Attendees will discuss representation and histories to contribute to new understandings in the field of museum practice, community engagement, history, and art history. 
Broaden interpretative strategies: Attendees will identify approaches to integrating multiple perspectives within exhibition, interpretations, and program. 
Increase capacity and skills for evaluation: Attendees will gain insights to various iterative and qualitative approaches to research and development as a key component of sustainability and scalability. 
Integrate community-based practices holistically within organizations: Attendees will reflect upon their mission, operational functions, and budget allocations as one strategy for expanding practices."""

Participants do not require any resources or prerequisites to attend."""

How can a museum with mission-driven priorities, a rotating exhibition schedule, and public programming allocate capital, both financial and human, toward community-based practices?
How might project funding support a change in practice to broaden exhibition development and collections care by integrating community engagement?
How can a museum begin to consider strategies to prioritize community-engaged practices and create a sustainable approach?
Presenters will also share implications for multiple departments within museums.

This session will explore innovations, impacts, and strategies for fostering collaborative and community-based curation. Presenters, comprised of community collaborators and museum professionals, will share a case study from the Tucson Museum of Art that offers a framework, tools, and questions for consideration when co-creating interpretative content. To illustrate community-curation practices, attendees will workshop a selection of artworks and themes from art of the American West to explore a 21st century vision of cultures and ideas.
