This session will explore a number of innovative partnerships between museums and medical institutions, and how anchoring a museum’s collection within the training of doctors, nurses, and healthcare providers can mean better outcomes for patients. We will also examine the growing interest in engaging with the medical humanities, and how patients are utilizing museums through new and innovative programs. Panelists will explore best practices, and how these partnerships can further center museums as community anchors.
