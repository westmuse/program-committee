session_objectives = """1. Identify opportunities for inclusion or collaboration with groups within the community an institution serves or their field of study. Discuss how a partnership can be formed that is beneficial to all parties involved. Examples include work with indigenous Tribes, local artists, and correctional institutions.
2. Discuss how to evaluate inquiries from outside organizations, groups, or individuals, and how to approach these entities to discuss a potential partnership. What expectations should be set? What agreements should be made? Examine the options for this financial risk, including consignment, wholesale and vendor fairs. Discuss the possibilities for risk and reward, and what to consider when deeming your collaboration a financial or mission-based success or failure.
3. Briefly examine the possibilities for interpretation within your institution’s retail area, including artist information, community and staff recommendations and reviews, and tie-ins to seasonal or temporary exhibits and themes. What community resources can the store provide? How can more members of your institution’s staff be involved in the gift shop’s operations?
"""

Ideas for discussion will be provided as well, including the opportunity to brainstorm an institution’s potential retail collaborators."""
