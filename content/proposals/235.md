2. Participants will be provided with information, resources, and actionable ways to combat some of these issues such as advocating for paid internships, finding ways to educate institutions on the importance of wage and salary transparency, and where to find support.
3. Participants will help brainstorm additional ways to support emerging museum professionals and how they can continue to move this conversation and action forward at their own institutions and in the museum field at large."""

Paid internships, salary transparency, and livable pay rates have the opportunity to become the rule, rather than the exception at museums. This session will explore these crucial topics and how they are impacting the next generation of museum professionals. Hear from a group of Emerging Museum Professionals with lived experiences, gather information and resources from the National Emerging Museum Professionals Network, and learn how to become an advocate for these best practices at your organization.
