Engaging in different types of play is central to how children grow their bodies and minds. Self-directed play and unstructured learning allow children to imagine and explore all senses of possibility. We will ask participants to critically think about their definition of play and their impressions of the role play plays in museum settings. By reframing the definitions of play, participants will get charged up to think differently about engaging early learners and caregivers in their space.
