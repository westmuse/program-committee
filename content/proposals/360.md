We are now facing an additional mandate to incorporate sustainability into our organizational practices. Sustainability is a large umbrella term that has different meanings in different contexts and to different people. This discussion will explore three main objectives: what “sustainability” means to stewards of cultural heritage, actions we can take to be more sustainable, and ways to implement sustainability. Beginning with our shared goals of sustaining collections for future generations through preventive care, we will explore the role of museums in practicing broader sustainability initiatives such as environmental sustainability, fiscal sustainability, organizational health, climate and social justice, and mental health of staff and community as well as the interconnectedness of these measures. Together the panel, moderator, and audience will tackle questions regarding what our sustainability priorities are, what institutional priorities have been established, the challenges we face in implementing sustainability measures, and what solutions have been enacted by panelists and audience members to implement sustainable practices within our institutions. The panel will bring their expertise to the conversation having all been recipients of grant funding to plan and implement sustainable practices within their organizations. The goal of this fishbowl session is to invigorate, share ideas, and problem solve, so we can go forth with renewed energy to balance collections care, access, and sustainability to preserve the longevity of our collections, institutions, and communities."""

The balance between collections preservation and access is familiar in theory and practice. We are now tasked to add a third element to this precarious balance: sustainability. Three panelists will discuss the challenges faced and solutions to incorporating sustainability measures in museums. The panel will consider the multifaceted meanings of sustainability including environmental and fiscal sustainability, longevity and resiliency of collections, and the museum’s role in sustaining communities through environmental and social justice.
