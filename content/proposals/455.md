session_objectives = """This workshop has three specific learning objects: Share our collective wisdom around decision making to understand when and why it works and doesn’t. Articulate the elements of a decision making process, so that we can design more intentional processes. Gain tools and practices to help us design better decision making processes back home. To achieve the first goal we use playful activities drawn from Theatre of the Oppressed to have participants reflect on their own experiences and practice in decision-making processes. To achieve the second goal we offer our own expertise in decision-making, providing frameworks and breakdowns of decision-making generally, and commonly used mechanisms ranging from unilateral to consensus. Towards the third goal we offer an activity that has participants reflect on their own values around decision-making, and then a related take home tool that can be used for designing decision-making processes. At the end of the workshop we will also provide participants with a handful of other simple tools and resources that support further learning and implementation of better decision-making practices.


Additionally, we bring a larger socio-political power analysis and framework, and we aim for participants to leave thinking about how the lessons learned apply to their personal lives, their professional lives, and our culture as a whole. “Breaking Down Decision Making” is part of a longer series of workshops introducing workplace democracy to cultural workers and connecting these concepts and practices to the fight for the collective liberation of all people from all systems of oppression."""
session_engagement = """The workshop uses a popular education pedagogy that pulls from the work of Fanny Lou Hamer, Paolo Freire, and Augusto Boal. Activities include games adapted from Theatre of the Oppressed, roleplays, physical mapping, and discussions. Take home resources, tools, and worksheets are from a variety of sources.  We will need access to audio and video set-ups, flip charts, and writing implements for all participants. We would request that participants wear masks for COVID safety."""
session_scalability = """Regardless of the size of an organization or team, regardless of how hierarchically or flatly the organization is governed and operated, decisions need to be made and the major decisions will impact everyone involved. This workshop provides tools, strategies, and frameworks that take into account all parts of these spectrums. The workshop also provides plenty of time for open discussion to crowd-source and engage with individual-situations where the concepts may seem harder to implement at first glance.

Whether we are trying to figure out what to have for dinner or our strategic vision for the next 5-years, decision making can be a major source of conflict and discomfort that recreates oppressive norms; But it doesn't have to be this way. In this participatory workshop, participants will gain tools and frameworks that break down the elements of decision making for more strategic, equitable, and transparent processes where everyone's needs can be met.
