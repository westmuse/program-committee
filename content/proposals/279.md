**A journey map is a visual representation of a museum’s engagement strategy. It provides a holistic view of the visitor experience across departments, skill sets, programming, content, platforms, and systems. The map identifies critical activities that connect visitors to key interactions, or touchpoints, before, during, and after a visit. This interactive session will provide insight into the strategic and tactical benefits of a journey map and how they benefit an audience engagement strategy.**
