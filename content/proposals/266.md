Objectives and learning outcomes: 1) audience members will learn how to engage with the process of large-scale institutional reckoning by aligning institutional ethics with Indigenous Stewardship best-practices and community centering, using Bishop Museum’s program as a case study for rematriating the museum at a policy and programmatic level, and creating future opportunities to expand these efforts through partnerships and fellowships; and 2) audience members will learn how the Museum’s initial re-envisioning of curatorial practice and collections stewardship is renewing community engagement and trust in Bishop Museum through collaborative knowledge production and increased access, which is taking shape as a model for Indigenous cultural collection stewardship. Audience members will learn how their home institutions can engage with Indigenizing practices in productive and responsive (not reactionary) ways."""

Institutions of different sizes can engage in decolonial and Indigenizing practices, using Bishop Museum’s Pacific Pipeline as a model, where over time, community input and collaboration can address questions relating to ownership, stewardship, ethics, and responsibility. Using the multi-phase, multi-year model for internal changes that radiate outwards, other institutions can also respond to the challenges they face with connecting and collaborating with Indigenous community members in meaningful, future-facing ways.

Bishop Museum recently began a multi-phase program called the Pacific Pipeline, to build internal capacity and support institution-wide implementation of Indigenous practices, and to collaboratively share how these practices can be upheld across the museum field. In this session, the program’s co-leads from collections and public program teams discuss the challenges and results of the Living Cultures project in Phase 1, and the transformational approaches to activating collections through cultural practitioners’ and knowledge bearers’ relationships to material culture.
