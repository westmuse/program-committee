session_objectives = """Objectives:
1.     Equip attendees with the foundational knowledge of disaster planning and risk assessment, ensuring they understand the critical elements of emergency preparedness. Participants will learn how to identify potential threats to their collections and the steps necessary to mitigate these risks effectively.
2.     Through the presentation of real-life case studies, attendees will see the practical application of emergency preparedness strategies in various museum contexts. This objective aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of well-implemented plans and encourage participants to reflect on how these approaches can be adapted to their situations.
3.     Engage attendees in problem-solving activities designed to apply what they've learned in a hands-on context. By working through scenarios that museums might face, participants will develop the skills to create, evaluate, and refine their emergency preparedness measures.

Learning Outcomes:
1.     Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how to conduct a risk assessment for their collections, identifying vulnerabilities and prioritizing actions.
2.     Participants will gain insight into successful emergency planning and response strategies, learning from the successes and challenges faced by others.

Armed with practical experience from problem-solving exercises, attendees will be better prepared to develop or enhance their institution's emergency preparedness plans, ensuring their collections are safeguarded against future crises."""
session_engagement = """Participants will actively engage in scenario-based problem-solving exercises, enabling real-time application of learned strategies. After a presentation that provides introduction to emergency planning components and demonstrates real life emergency plans and scenarios from panelists, groups will discuss pre-written emergency scenarios to facilitate dynamic discussion, ensuring concepts are understood and applicable. Resources required to deliver this session include slideshow presentation equipment and the ability for group discussion. This approach ensures attendees not only absorb information but can also apply it, fostering a proactive mindset towards emergency preparedness in their organizations."""
session_scalability = """The outcomes of this session are designed to be universally applicable, ensuring that museums of any type and size can effectively prepare for and respond to emergencies. The principles of disaster planning, risk assessment, and emergency measures are scalable, allowing small community museums to implement them with limited resources, while larger institutions can adapt these strategies to manage more extensive collections and facilities. By focusing on a comprehensive understanding of risk and the development of adaptable emergency plans, attendees will gain the skills to protect their collections, irrespective of the specific challenges or scale they face. The variety of collections the panelists care for also contributes to the applicability of a variety of collection types.

Whether your museum is proactively planning for a crisis or faces imminent danger, emergency planning is essential for collecting organizations. Focused on disaster planning, risk assessment, and implementation of emergency preparedness measures, attendees will learn emergency preparedness essentials, listen to real-life case studies, and work through problem-solving activities. This session, led by the board members of the Registrars Committee-Western Region (RC-WR), equips museum professionals with knowledge and strategies to safeguard collections from disasters.
