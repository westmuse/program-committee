Museums play an essential role in preserving, interpreting, and presenting the cultural and artistic legacies of diverse communities. Among these, Indigenous peoples’ art, knowledge, and histories are fundamental to understanding the broader cultural landscape. As institutions dedicated to cultural stewardship, museums hold a unique responsibility to engage Indigenous artists, voices, and organizations in a manner that fosters meaningful dialogue and promotes cultural preservation in both historical and contemporary contexts. Through discussion and case studies this session will advocate for an authentic approach to integrating Indigenous perspectives into museum programs, exhibitions, collections, and outreach.
