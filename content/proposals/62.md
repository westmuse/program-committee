Residencies are increasingly being recognized as a valuable tool for bringing new audiences and ideas into museum settings, yet there is little consistency in the approach or language around these programs. This session will explore questions of what a residency can be, as well as the challenges, opportunities and audiences associated with them. Come hear examples from several institutions, each with a distinct mission, as they discuss different approaches to residency programs.
