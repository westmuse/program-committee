How do you preserve your bandwidth and sanity? Do you practice the fine art of “saying no”? These days, when everything seems overwhelming, operating at pre-pandemic levels can leave us utterly depleted and burned out. The world has changed. We can’t successfully care for museums without caring for ourselves. How do we recalibrate our workloads to a sustainable level? Join us for reasons why we should adjust our concept of what is possible in today’s world—and tips for “saying no”. The session will begin with a fish bowl conversation between the presenters and then open up to a Q&A and small group discussions.
