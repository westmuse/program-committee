**Municipal Museums have a unique relationship when working with Tribal consultation. As Museum professionals, we play the role of envoys from our Council and City Management and Tribal representatives are envoys for their Council and Tribal Management. As such, we are formally negotiating between two world views and two sovereign Nations. We will use recent examples of consultation regarding the role museums play, including name changes, the development of programming, exhibits, and more. **
