Through exhibitions, programs, and content, the Portland Art Museum, Seattle Art Museum, and Museum of Natural and Cultural History have partnered with Anthony Hudson (Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde)—the artist who transforms into Portland’s premier drag clown, Carla Rossi—to initiate intersecting conversations around identity, gender, capitalism, and white supremacy. Come explore ways in which museums can challenge and address these issues while simultaneously creating fun, welcoming, affirmative, and joyful spaces.
