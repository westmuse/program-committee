2.    Explore different approaches currently in progress for new native-centric exhibits at the High Desert Museum, the Chapin Mesa Museum, Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park, and other exhibits of different scales to better understand different strategies for engagement and collaboration which can be applied to exhibit projects large and small.
3.    Discuss how the opportunity presented by an exhibit design process can be used to foster an ongoing and authentic dialog between museums and native groups beyond the scope of a single project. While this is an aspirational goal, a genuine dialog during design can help to strengthen relationships and establish trust in the long run."""

**This session will explore different methods and processes for not only the inclusion of indigenous peoples in the exhibit design process, but how to elevate and center their voices in the heart of exhibition storytelling. Through a series of in-progress case studies, we will discuss strategies for authentic, deep partnerships and outreach, dialog, and goal setting for exhibitions that bring forward native stories.**
