session_objectives = """- Master NOISE Analysis for Strategic Growth
    - Participants will learn how to implement NOISE analysis—Needs, Opportunities, Improvements, Strengths, and Exceptions—as a measurable, stakeholder-driven strategic planning tool. By engaging diverse perspectives, attendees will discover how to generate actionable insights that elevate their museum’s decision-making and long-term planning.
- Apply NOISE Analysis in Real Time
    - Through an interactive, hands-on NOISE analysis of the WMA conference, participants will experience the tool in action. They’ll practice identifying strengths, pinpointing areas for growth, and categorizing feedback, leaving with a clear understanding of how to apply this method in their own institutions.
- Elevate Organizational Impact with Measurable Results
    - Attendees will explore how NOISE can be used as an ongoing tracking mechanism to measure progress on strategic initiatives. By deploying NOISE annually, museums can assess growth, adjust strategies, and ensure their plans remain relevant and responsive—leading to tangible, data-driven improvements that elevate institutional success.

By the end of the session, participants will have a practical, adaptable tool to bring back to their museums, allowing them to engage stakeholders, track measurable results, and elevate their institution’s impact with confidence and clarity."""
session_engagement = """This session will engage participants through hands-on, interactive exercises, including a live NOISE analysis of the WMA conference. Attendees will participate with the presenters to assess key areas of the conference experience, categorizing feedback within the NOISE framework. Real-time collaboration and group discussions will ensure active participation. Resources needed include projector/screens to display group feedback."""
session_scalability = """The outcomes of this session are highly scalable and adaptable to museums of all sizes and types. Whether a small, community-driven museum or a large, multi-disciplinary institution, NOISE analysis provides a flexible framework for strategic planning. The tool can be customized to suit different organizational structures, from small staff teams to larger, cross-departmental collaborations. By focusing on measurable results and stakeholder engagement, NOISE empowers organizations to track progress, refine priorities, and elevate impact, regardless of size or scope.
