Protecting our climate and biodiversity is not just a science problem—it’s a cultural problem with relevance for all cultural institutions. As social spaces and trusted sources of accurate information, museums are well positioned to support productive, solution-focused visitor engagement with climate change and conservation. Join us to share strategies for building climate literacy and exploring community solutions. Presenters will discuss lessons learned from exhibits and programs to move our collective response to climate change forward.
