Open mic of the audience’s stories of change toward health and happiness will be included. We emphasize that one’s joy needs to be evaluated at every stage of one’s career."""
session_objectives = """Inspire people to think about alternative paths, (e.g., leaving museums, then returning) so that everyone can begin looking at their current situation and think in small moves, rather than large ones. Know that most people change their focus often. Meet some people who may become peer mentors."""

Did you have a mentor/friend who helped you decide? How did you know it was time to start looking for change? After each question we will ask a different audience member to also answer the question. The take-away will be a variety of strategies on how to make a change in one’s career."""

Do you find yourself in a position that has lost its luster, become slightly unfulfilling, or overwhelming? It may not be an awful job, but is it stretching your mind and heart? Do you love the institution but just have the wrong job, or do you dislike the place but love the job? How do you evaluate your circumstance and make a plan for a change? In this session you will hear from museum professionals who made transitions - some radical shifts and others subtle.
