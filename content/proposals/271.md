Monarch Generations VR is designed for teen and adult audiences. Discussion will focus on the app and VR creation process, partnerships with regional water agencies, subject area experts, and the development of an assessment tool to evaluate content retention and user experience. With both projects, our goal is to promote empathy by understanding of our water resources and the importance of preserving local habitats.  

Key takeaways will include: 
o Small museums can produce high quality digital content 
o Finding funding o Hiring the right vendor 
o Importance of cross departmental teamwork and strong project management 
o Setting clear goals and purpose for a project 
o Steps to evaluation 
o Theory of Change Model 
o Connecting digital technologies to exhibit content"""

Experience the hands-on digital interactive components of the Ontario Museum of History & Art’s (OMHA) newest permanent exhibition: _Built on Water: Ontario and Inland Southern California_. OMHA will highlight two interactive projects : _Water Keepers,_ a mobile application that explores the past, present and future of water management through a gamified experience and _Monarch Generations_ a Virtual Reality (VR) experience that uses social emotional learning to explore local ecology through the lens of the monarch butterfly’s migration.
