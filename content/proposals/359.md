Intended learning outcomes:
- Participants will leave having made meaningful connections with other museum folk.
- Participants will leave understanding some of the conditions that lead to imbalance and tactics for mitigating those conditions.
- Participants will leave with a start to identifying what balance and resilience means for them and strategies, shared by all participants, for continuing beyond the conference."""

**Working in the cultural sector is fun, right? But, is it still fun when you’re overworked, underpaid, burnt out, and your work/life balance is out of whack? How do you mitigate swings in balance as you evolve in your career or project? Join an intimate conversation on how to build resilience and tactics for better balance, discuss how to step up/step back as you learn what resilience and balance means for you. **
