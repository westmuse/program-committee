1b) Describe the 4 predominant (and inaccurate) narratives that impact how AANHPIs are perceived
2a) Identify at least one step they can personally take to better support AANHPI communities
3a) Identify at least one step their department or museum can take to improve DEAI efforts for AANHPI communities"""

Nearly half of the Asian Americans in the US live in the West. The AANHPI population is estimated to triple in size by 2060. FORWARD-thinking institutions must more meaningfully embrace the past, current, and future of AANHPI communities."""
theme_comments = """Additional details about Session Format
Below is planned session for 1.25 hour session and can be adapted for 1/2 day workshop.
1\.	The session will begin with brief didactic overview of key AANHPI community facts, figures, and histories. 
2\.	Participants will demonstrate their knowledge and perspectives through Slido (www.sli.do) polling.
3\.	Participants will then participate in a knowledge café to discuss what they collectively know and understand about the 4 predominant AANHPI narratives (i.e. model minority myth; treatment as perpetual foreigners; othering and invisibility; hyper-sexualization and de-masculinization).
4\.	Presenters will then engage in a series of mini-Ignite talks highlighting experiences and strategies from different AANHPI-focused museums and AANHPI-identified museum leaders.
5\.	Participants will then have the opportunity to engage in pairs conversations to synthesize their learnings and identify at least two potential action steps they might take post-workshop.

Additional Presenters
We also hope to add an NHPI presenter.

The diverse histories, cultures, perspectives, and experiences of the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) diaspora are often missing from or kept to the edges of diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion (DEAI) efforts in the museum sector. This session will provide participants an opportunity to consider and reflect upon the narratives that continue to impact AANHPI communities and potential steps that individual and organizational allies can take to improve meaningful inclusion and access.
