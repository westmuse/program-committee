 Teen Science Café programs are free, fun ways for teens to engage in lively conversations and participate in STEM activities. Individual café sites have explored everything from astronomy to zoology, but some sites have created highly focused cafes. Learn about how to start a Teen Science Café focused on your museum’s mission, create a vision board of your ideal Teen Science Café, and walk away with a draft implementation plan to start your own thematic café.
