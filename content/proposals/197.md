Now, more than ever, museums have the opportunity to lead efforts in the fight against enmity and injustice. Whether through neighborhood interactions, programs, exhibitions, collecting, or educational efforts, our organizations are public centers for deterring hate and promoting diversity, understanding, and respect. Panelists from four culturally specific institutions will consider new insights and approaches for facing the immediate future, drawing upon their institutional approaches to the abovenamed issues.
