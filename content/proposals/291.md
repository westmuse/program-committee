 As some of the most trusted institutions in the United States, museums can play an important role in supporting, initiating, catalyzing, and teaching about climate action. In this session, learn about the actions of two small museums—Marin Museum of Contemporary Art, the Palo Alto Art Center—and a volunteer collective working to create change in museum programming and operations. This session will include an interactive component that allows participants to start considering a climate action plan.
