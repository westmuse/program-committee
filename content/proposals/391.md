2. A new approach to try or resource to look into. This depends on who attends the session, but we feel confident participants will have both challenges to vent about and success stories to share. Participants will be exposed to an array of ideas/strategies to help them problem-solve, or make a connection with a peer that can build community and feel empowered to try something different. 
3. Solidarity among museum professionals who struggle working with community members. This work--whether it's those with community engagement in their title, or development, or those who oversee event planning--can be very emotionally/psychologically draining. So hoping that participants feel validated and "seen" by others in this session."""
session_engagement = """Audience will be seated in tables/groups. Conversations will be highly structured using de Bono's Six Thinking Hats process (white= information needed, yellow= optimism, black= risks, etc.) Following this protocol provides structure to the conversation, while modeling the process itself. That way, participants --if nothing else--can take that back to their institutions. Share-outs will be kept focused and timing will help it feel fast-paced and fun."""

Each museum interacts with the community in different ways but regardless if in small ways or large ways, there are bumps and bruises along the journey--that hopefully can be smoothed out with advice from your fellow museum professional.

Get ready for lively conversation about everything we come across when attempting to balance the demands and desires of outside stakeholders with our museum's capacity. Whether it's a city's censorship of your exhibit or an outside collaborator who has no clue they need to abide deadlines...let's share and learn from others who live to tell the tale! Spoiler: we'll be modeling Edward de Bono's "Six Thinking Hats"--a simple and effect (and fun!) thinking process.
