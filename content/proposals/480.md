In reorienting Western Shoshoni language revitalization efforts, museums have an important role to play in cultural knowledge repatriation. In taking a closer look at Western Shoshoni Language revitalization efforts we will be hosting a discourse/discussion of how language revitalization efforts must first be rooted in community well-being and how museums should support indigenous language revitalization. This includes empowering community run education programs, dissemination of language materials, and creating pathways for access.
