Docent Role
It seems like the docent world and museum staff worlds can be very different, sometimes separate/disconnected, and misunderstood.
A great opportunity to invite/involve Docents who may have a lot to learn from us, (maybe vice versa). Docents have their conferences, but could benefit from what WMA offers; and could lead to our leaders, members, and attendees being invited to Docent conferences where we can educate them in ways they might be missing.
